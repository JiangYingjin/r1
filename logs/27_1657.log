-------------------- Question:
A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all? 
Answer:
476 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, first, we need to calculate the cost of each ticket after the discount. Since Mr. Benson bought more than 10 tickets (12), he gets a 5% discount on any ticket bought above 10. 

He buys 12 tickets, so he gets a discount on the 12 - 10 = 2 extra tickets. Each of these 2 extra tickets has the discount of 40 * 0.05 = $2. Hence, the total discount for these 2 tickets is 2 * $2 = $4.

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount: 12 tickets * $40 = $480. Then we subtract the discount received: $480 - $4 = $476. Thus, Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for the 12 concert tickets.

Over the past five years, on July 4th, the high temperature for Washington, DC has been: 90 degrees in 2020, 90 degrees in 2019, 90 degrees in 2018, 79 degrees in 2017 and 71 degrees in 2016. What is the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past 5 years? 
Answer:
84 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the average temperature over the past five years, we need to perform the following steps:
1. Sum up all the recorded temperatures.
2. Divide the sum by the number of years (5 in this case).

Let's calculate it step by step.
The recorded temperatures are 90, 90, 90, 79, and 71 degrees Fahrenheit.
The sum of these temperatures is:
90 + 90 + 90 + 79 + 71 = 410 degrees Fahrenheit.

Now, to find the average temperature, we divide the sum by the number of years:
410 / 5 = 82 degrees Fahrenheit.

Matt can make a batch of a dozen cookies using 2 pounds of flour.  He uses 4 bags of flour each weighing 5 pounds.  If Jim eats 15 cookies how many cookies are left? 
Answer:
105 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, let's proceed step by ilustration.

1. First, we calculate the total amount of flour available from the 4 bags. Each bag is 5 pounds and Matt has 4 bags. So, the total amount of flour available is \(4 \times 5 = 20\) pounds.

2. Given that Matt can make a dozen (12) cookies with 2 pounds of flour, we can determine how many dozens of cookies he can make with the total amount of flour. We use the proportion:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ cookies}}{2 \text{ pounds}} = \frac{x \text{ cookies}}{20 \text{ pounds}} \]
where \(x\) is the number of cookies he can make with 20 pounds of flour.

3. Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{12 \times 20}{2} \]

Janelle had 26 green marbles. Then she bought 6 bags of blue marbles. There were 10 marbles in each bag.  She created a gift of 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles and gave it to a friend. How many marbles does Janelle have now? 
Answer:
72 
Response:
<reasoning>
Janelle initially had 26 green marbles. She bought 6 bags of blue marbles, with each bag containing 流星10子 blue marbles, so she got \( 6 \times 10 = 60 \) blue marbles. The total number of marbles Janelle had before giving the gift is \( 26 + 60 = 86 \).

Janelle gave a gift of 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles. Thus, she gave away a total of \( 6 + 8 = 14 \) marbles.

So, the number of marbles Janelle has now is the initial total minus the marbles given away: \( 86 - 14 = 72 \) marbles.

Zach baked cookies for a bake sale. On Monday he baked 32 cookies. On Tuesday he ran out of sugar and could only bake half of the number of cookies he baked the day before. On Wednesday he baked three times the number of cookies he did on Tuesday, but his brother ate 4 of those cookies. How many cookies did he have at the end of the three days? 
Answer:
92 
Response:
<reasoning>
We need to calculate the total number of cookies baked over the three days. 

- On Monday, Zach baked 32 cookies.
- On Tuesday, he baked a half of the number of cookies he baked on Monday. 
- On Wednesday, he baked three times the number of cookies he baked on Tuesday, but his brother ate 4 of those cookies.

First, we should find out how many cookies Zach baked on Tuesday. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Cookies on Tuesday} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \]

Then, we can determine how many cookies he baked on Wednesday before his brother ate 4 cookies:
\[ \text{Cookies on Wednesday before his brother ate} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]
\[ \text{Cookies on Wednesday after his brother ate} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Andy walks 50 meters from his house to school. After school, he comes back to the house and goes to the market. If he walks 140 meters in total, how many meters is the distance between the house and the market? 
Answer:
40 
Response:
<reasoning>
We know that Andy walks 50 meters from his house to school and then another 50 meters back from school to the house. The problem states that the total distance he walks is 140 meters. We can calculate the distance from the house to the market by subtracting the known segments from the total distance walked.

First, calculate the distance Andy has already walked:
- Distance from house to school = 50 meters
- Back and forth distance (house to school and back) = 2 * 50 = 100 meters

Now, subtract this distance from the total distance:
- Total distance walked = 140 meters
- Distance already walked (house to school and back) = 100 meters

This will give us the distance from the house to the market:
- Distance from house to market = Total distance walked - Distance already walked
- Distance from house to market = 140 - 1

Jessica’s class is going to a farm for a field trip. The school will bring all 35 students in the class plus 4 adult chaperones. The farm entrance fee for students costs $5 and $6 for adults. How much will the school pay for the farm entrance in all? 
Answer:
199 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine the total cost for the farm entrance fees, we need to calculate the cost for students and adult chaperones separately and then add these together.

- The number of students is 35, and each student's entrance fee is $5. Therefore, the total cost for the students is \(35 \times 5 = 175\) dollars.
- The number of adult chaperones is 4, and each adult's entrance fee is $6. Therefore, the total cost for the adults is \(4 \times 6 = 24\) dollars.
- To find the total cost, we add the cost for students and adult chaperones: \(175 + 24 = 199\) dollars.

-------------------- Question:
Tony lifts weights as a form of exercise.  He can lift 90 pounds with one arm in the exercise known as "the curl."  In an exercise known as "the military press," he can lift over his head twice the weight that he can curl.  His favorite exercise is known as "the squat" and he can squat 5 times the weight that he can lift in the military press.  How much weight, in pounds, can Tony lift in the squat exercise? 
Answer:
900 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how much weight Tony can lift in the squat exercise, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, identify the weight Tony can lift with one arm in the "the curl" exercise, which is 90 pounds.
2. Since "the military press" involves lifting twice the weight he can curl, we multiply 90 pounds by 2:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Now, in "the squat" exercise, Tony can lift 5 times the weight he can lift in the military press. Therefore, we multiply 180 pounds by 5:
   \[
   180 \times 5 = 900 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The final result, 900 pounds, represents the weight Tony can lift in the squat exercise.

Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first? 
Answer:
17 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's break down the problem step by damaged how much money Michael's brother initially had before buying candy. We can denote the initial amount of money Michael's brother had as \( x \).

1. Michael originally had $42 and gave half of it to his brother, which was $42 / 2 = $21. 
2. This means the brother now had $x + $21.
3. The brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. After spending $3, he is left with $35.
4. This can be set up as an equation to find $x$:
   \[
   (x + 21) - 3 = 35
   \]
5. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   x + 18 = 35
   \]
6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 35 - 18 =

-------------------- Question:
Barry, Thomas and Emmanuel are to share a jar of 200 jelly beans. If Thomas takes 10%, and Barry and Emmanuel are to share the remainder in the ratio 4:5 respectively, how many jelly beans will Emmanuel get? 
Answer:
100 
Response:
<reasoning>
First, calculate the number of jelly beans Thomas takes, which is 10% of the total 200 jelly beans. To find 10% of 200, we perform the following calculation: 
\[ 200 \times 0.10 = 20 \]
Thomas takes 20 jelly beans, and the remaining jelly beans to be shared between Barry and Emmanuel is:
\[ 200 - 20 = 180 \]
Barry and Emmanuel share the remaining 180 jelly beans in the ratio 4:5. The total parts in this ratio is \(4 + 5 = 9\). Thus, each part of the ratio corresponds to:
\[ \frac{180}{9} = 20 \]
Barry's share, which is 4 parts, will be:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

-------------------- Question:
Andy is a lawyer who's working on two lawsuits. The first lawsuit has a 30% chance of paying out $5,000,000 upon a win and $0 if he loses it. The second lawsuit has a 50% chance of paying out $1,000,000 if Andy loses and a 50% chance of paying out $2,000,000 if he wins.  Expressed as a percentage, how much more likely is it that Andy loses both lawsuits compared to winning both of them? 
Answer:
20 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of Andy's outcomes in both lawsuits and then compare them.

1. **First lawsuit:**
   - Probability of winning: 30% or 0.3
   - Probability of losing: 70% or 0.7

2. **Second lawsuit:**
   - Probability of winning (P_Win_2): 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of losing (P_Lose_2): 50% or 0.5

3. **Outcome:**
   - Probability of winning both lawsuits (P_win_both) = P_Win_1 * P_Win_2
   - Probability of losing both lawsuits (P_lose_both) = P_Lose_1 * P_Lose_2

Let's compute these probabilities:
   - P_win_both = 0.3 * 0.5 = 0.1

John is half times younger than his father, who is 4 years older than John's mother. If John's father is 40 years old, what's the age difference between John and his mother? 
Answer:
16 
Response:
<reasoning>
First, we know John's father is 40 years old. Given that John is half as old as his father, John's age can be calculated as half of his father's age:

\[ \text{John's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Father's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ years old} \]

We are also informed that John's father is 4 years older than his mother. Therefore, we can find the mother's age by subtracting 4 years from John's father's age:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ years old} \]

To find the age difference between John and his mother, we calculate the absolute difference between John's age and his mother's age:

Lisa has decided to replace her old cutlery. As she is going through the cupboards, she sees the spoons from when each of her 4 children were babies as well as 2 decorative spoons she created. She doesn't want to get rid of any of these so she adds them to her new set of cutlery. The new set of cutlery has 10 large spoons and 15 teaspoons. If the children each had 3 spoons when they were babies, how many spoons does Lisa now have? 
Answer:
39 
Response:
<reasoning>
Lisa initially has the 4 children's baby spoons and 2 decorative spoons. Each child had 3 baby spoons, so there are 4 * 3 = 12 baby spoons in total. Adding the 2 decorative spoons, Lisa has a total of 12 + 2 = 14 old cutlery spoons. She adds these to her new set of 10 large spoons and 15 teaspoons. Thus, the number of cutlery spoons Lisa has now is the sum of the new set of cutlery spoons and the old ones she didn't get rid of. This would be 10 + 15 + 14.

<answer>
The total number of spoons Lisa now has is 10 large spoons + 15 teaspoons + 14 old cutlery spoons = 39 spoons.

Marites internet speed is 10 megabits per second and her monthly internet bill is $20. Marites is planning to upgrade her service and choosing between 20 Mbps and 30 Mbps. If the price of the 30 Mbps is twice the amount of her current monthly bill and the price of the 20 Mbps is $10 more than her current monthly bill, how much will she save per year if she chooses the 20 Mbps than 30 Mbps? 
Answer:
120 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how much Marites will save per year if she chooses the 20 Mbps service over the 30 Mbps service, we need to compute the annual bill for both options and then find the difference. Marites's current monthly bill is $20. 

For the 30 Mbps service, the price is twice the current monthly bill. Therefore, the monthly cost of the 30 Mbps service is:
\[ 30 \text{ Mbps service} = 2 \times 20 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The annual cost for the 30 Mbps service will be:
\[ 40 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 480 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Suzie and 5 of her friends decide to rent an Airbnb at Lake Tahoe for 4 days from Thursday to Sunday. The rental rate for weekdays is $420 per day. The weekend rental rate is $540 per day. They all decide to split the rental evenly. How much does each person have to pay? 
Answer:
320 
Response:
<reasoning>
Suzie and her 5 friends make a total of 6 people. They plan to rent the Airbnb for 4 days: Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The prices are $420 per day for weekdays (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday) and $540 per day for the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).

First, calculate the total cost for the weekdays:
- 3 days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday) at $420 per day = 3 * $420 = $1260.

Next, calculate the total cost for the weekend:
- 2 days (Saturday, Sunday) at $540 per day = 2 * $540 = $1080.

Now, add the weekday and weekend costs to find the total rental cost:

Horatio is a poet composing sonnets for his lady fair. He believes it will take many of his sonnets to win her over. Each sonnet is fourteen lines long. His lady fair tells him to leave her alone after he reads her only seven sonnets, and Horatio is heartbroken over the 70 romantic lines he wrote that she never heard. How many sonnets did Horatio write in all? 
Answer:
12 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's determine how many sonnets Horatio wrote by finding out how many sonnets he composed before his lady fair stopped him. 

Horatio read 7 sonnets to his lady fair. Since each sonnet consists of  cavirlines, we can multiply the number of sonnets read by the number of lines per sonnet to find the total number of lines he read. 

The total number of lines he read is: \( 7 \text{ sonnets} \times 14 \text{ lines/sonnet} = 98 \text{ lines} \).

According to the problem, Horatio composed lines that his lady fair never heard, which are 70 lines. This implies that the 98 lines he read (which includes these lines he never read) constitutes the total number of lines he wrote. Thus, the number of lines he wrote but never gave to his lady fair is the difference between the total lines written and the

A party hall has 3 decorative light bulbs; a red light bulb which comes on every 2 seconds, a green one every 3 seconds and a blue one every 4 seconds. If they are put on at the same time, what is the shortest time after which the three bulbs will be on at the same time? 
Answer:
12 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the shortest time after which all three light bulbs will be on at the same time, we are essentially finding the least common multiple (LCM) of their on times: 2 seconds for the red bulb, 3 seconds for the green bulb, and 5 seconds for the blue bulb (since their on times don't include a 4 second cycle, this is equivalent to 5 seconds).

The LCM of a set of numbers can be calculated by finding the prime factors of each number and finding the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorization. For the numbers 2, 3, and 5, the LCM is the product of these numbers because they are all prime and don’t share any common factors other than 1.

So, LCM(2, 3, 5) = 2 * 3 * 5 = 30.

Frank is practicing a new dance move.  It starts with him take 5 steps back, and then 10 steps forward, and then 2 steps back, and then double that amount forward.  How many steps forward is Frank from his original starting point? 
Answer:
7 
Response:
<reasoning>
Frank’s movements can be summed up by considering the steps forward and backward in separate calculations. First, we'll determine how many steps back or forward he is after the first two phases of the move. Then, we'll calculate the third phase, which is double the result of the third step in the initial phase.

Starting from his original point, Frank takes:
- 5 steps back: This means he is 5 steps behind.
- 10 steps forward: This means he is 5 steps back and 10 steps forward, a net of 5 steps forward (10 - 5 = 5).

Now we compute the next two steps:
- 2 steps back: This pushes him further behind, meaning he is 5 + 2 = 7 steps behind.

For the final phase, he takes double the amount of the third step in the first phase, which was 2 steps. That is:

1. **Value if Carlos spends them in a store:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - If Carlos has \( Q \) quarters, the total value in the store would be \( 0.25 \times Q \).

2. **Value if Carlos melts them down:**
   - Each quarter weighs \( \frac{1}{5} \) of an ounce.
   - The total weight of \( Q \) quarters is \( Q \times \frac{1}{5} \) ounces.
   - If Carlos melts them down, he can get $100 per ounce.
   - Therefore, the total value when melted down is \( Q \times \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20Q \

Bert bought some unique stamps for his collection. Before the purchase, he had only half the stamps he bought. If he bought 300 stamps, how many stamps does Bert have in total after the purchase? 
Answer:
450 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of stamps Bert had before the purchase, which is half the number of stamps he bought. Given that he bought .elementAt(10) stamps, we can set up the equation to find the total number of stamps he has now, which is the initial number plus the number of stamps he bought.

Let \( x \) be the initial number of stamps Bert had. According to the problem, before the purchase, Bert had half the number of stamps he bought, so,
\[ x = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, the total number of stamps he has now is the initial number \( x \) plus the number of stamps he bought (300).

\[ \text{Total stamps} = 150 + 300 \]

Now, calculate the total number of stamps.

Haman’s father has an egg business supplying the local market. On a Wednesday morning, his father sends him to go and collect 10 trays of eggs for sale from their store. While loading the eggs into the car, he accidentally drops two trays. He calls his father telling him this, and is told to add 7 more trays for sale. How many eggs were sold that day? 
Answer:
540 
Response:
<reasoning>
- Initially, Haman was supposed to collect 10 trays of eggs.
- He dropped 2 trays, resulting in 10 - 2 = 8 trays left.
- His father instructed to add 7 more trays, making the total number of trays to be sold: 8 + 7 = 15 trays.
- Typically, there would be 12 eggs per tray, so the total number of eggs sold that day would be 15 trays * 12 eggs/tray.

All 20 of Grant’s baby teeth have fallen out and he has a total of $54 from the tooth fairy. Every time he lost a tooth, he put it under his pillow for the tooth fairy, except for one that he dropped on the way home from school and another he swallowed accidentally. The tooth fairy left Grant $20 when he lost his first tooth. How much did the tooth fairy leave him per tooth after his first tooth, assuming equal money exchanged for each tooth thereafter? 
Answer:
2 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how much the tooth fairy left per tooth for the remaining 18 teeth, we need to start by determining the total amount of money the tooth fairy left after the first tooth. We can do this by subtracting the $20 from the tooth fairy left for the first tooth from the total amount of $54. 

After that, we will divide the remaining amount by the number of teeth (18) to find out how much the tooth fairy left per tooth after the first tooth. 

Let's perform the calculations step-by-step:
1. Subtract the $20 for the first tooth from the total $54.
2. Divide the remaining amount by 18 to get the amount per tooth after the first tooth.

</reasoning>
<answer>
1. Subtracting the $20 from the total $54 gives:

Mrs. Wilsborough saved $500 to buy concert tickets for her family. She bought 2 VIP tickets at $100 each and 3 regular tickets at $50 each. How much of her savings does Mrs. Wilsborough have after she buys the tickets? 
Answer:
150 
Response:
<reasoning>
Mrs. Wilsborough initially saved $500. The cost of buying 2 VIP tickets is calculated by multiplying the number of tickets by the price each ticket. The total cost for the VIP tickets is $100 * 2 = $200. The cost of 3 regular tickets is $50 * 3 = $150. Therefore, the total cost of all the tickets is $200 + $150 = $350. To find out how much she has left of her savings, we subtract the total cost of the tickets from her savings: $500 - $350 = $150.

Tommy's mother lets him ride his bike 2 blocks north of his block, 3 blocks east, 2 blocks west, and 2 blocks south. His friend's father lets his friend ride his bike 80 square blocks. How many times greater is the area his friend can ride in compared to Tommy? 
Answer:
4 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, we need to determine the areas that Tommy and his friend can ride their bikes and then compare these areas.

First, we need to understand the area Tommy can ride his bike within. Tommy is allowed to ride:
- 2 blocks north,
- 3 blocks east,
- 2 blocks west,
- 2 blocks south.

The total number of blocks he can ride in any direction can be considered as the extent of his riding area. If we consider the north-south extent as 2 blocks and the east-west extent as 3 blocks, the total riding area would be the area of a rectangle with dimensions 5 blocks (2 + 2 + 1 = 5 since the north-south extent is 2 blocks north + the entire street + 2 blocks south, making it 5 blocks) by 3 blocks. Therefore, the area Tommy can ride is 5 * 3 = 15 square blocks.
