A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all? 
Answer:
476 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how much Mr. Benson paid, we need to calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets and then apply the discount for the remaining 2 tickets.

1. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets:**
   - Each ticket costs $40.
   - Therefore, the cost for 10 tickets is \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the additional 2 tickets with a discount:**
   - Normally, each ticket costs $40.
   - He receives a 5% discount for each ticket beyond the 10th.
   - The discount per ticket is \(5\% \times 40 = 0.05 \times 40 = 2\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the discounted price per ticket is \(40 - 2 = 38\) dollars.
   - The cost for 2 discounted tickets is \(2 \times 38 = 76\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   - Add the cost of the first 10 tickets and the cost of the discounted 2 tickets:  
   \(400 + 76 = 476\) dollars.

Thus, Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for all 12 tickets.

-------------------- Question:
Jane is trying to decide whether to buy a house or a trailer. A house costs $480,000 and a trailer costs $120,000. Each loan will be paid in monthly installments over 20 years. How much more is the monthly payment on the house compared to the trailer? 
Answer:
1500 
Response:
<reasoning>
To compare the monthly payments for both the house and the trailer, we will calculate the monthly payments for each and then find the difference. We assume the following for simplicity:

1. **Loan Amounts:**
   - House: $480,000
   - Trailer: $120,000

2. **Loan Term:** 20 years = 240 months

3. **Interest Rate:** Without explicit information on the interest rate, we typically use a common mortgage rate when evaluating scenarios like this. However, without specific information, we might use a hypothetical interest rate for demonstration purposes. Let's assume a common mortgage interest rate of 4% per annum (0.04/12 per month) for both loans. 

The formula to calculate the monthly payment \( M \) for a loan is given by:

\[
M = P \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal loan amount,
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of payments.

Let's calculate the monthly payment for both the house and the trailer using this formula.

**Step-by-step Calculations:**

1. **Calculate \( r \):**  
   The annual interest rate is 4%, so the monthly interest rate \( r \) is:  
   \[
   r = \frac{0.04}{12} = 0.003333\ldots
   \]

2. **Calculate \( n \):**  
   The loan term is 20 years, so \( n \) is:  
   \[
   n = 20 \times 12 = 240
   \]

3. **Monthly Payment for the House:**  
   \[
   M_{\text{house}} = 480,000 \times \frac{0.003333\ldots(1 + 0.003333\ldots)^{240}}{(1 + 0.003333\ldots)^{240} - 1}
   \]

   Calculate \((1 + 0.003333\ldots)^{240}\):  
   \[
   (1.003333\ldots)^{240} \approx 2.191123
   \]

   Substitute back into the formula for \( M_{\text{house}} \):  
   \[
   M_{\text{house}} = 480,000 \times \frac{0.003333\ldots \times 2.191123}{2.191123 - 1}
   \]
   \[
   M_{\text{house}} = 480,000 \times \frac{0.0073037}{1.191123}
   \]
   \[
   M_{\text{house}} \approx 480,000 \times 0.006131
   \]
   \[
   M_{\text{house}} \approx 2,942.88
   \]

4. **Monthly Payment for the Trailer:**  
   \[
   M_{\text{trailer}} = 120,000 \times \frac{0.003333\ldots(1 +

   \]
   \[
   M_{\text{house}} \approx 2,942.88
