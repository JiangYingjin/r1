A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all? 
Answer:
476 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how much Mr. Benson paid, we need to calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets and then apply the discount for the remaining 2 tickets.

1. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets:**
   - Each ticket costs $40.
   - Therefore, the cost for 10 tickets is \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the additional 2 tickets with a discount:**
   - Normally, each ticket costs $40.
   - He receives a 5% discount for each ticket beyond the 10th.
   - The discount per ticket is \(5\% \times 40 = 0.05 \times 40 = 2\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the discounted price per ticket is \(40 - 2 = 38\) dollars.
   - The cost for 2 discounted tickets is \(2 \times 38 = 76\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   - Add the cost of the first 10 tickets and the cost of the discounted 2 tickets:  
   \(400 + 76 = 476\) dollars.

Thus, Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for all 12 tickets.

-------------------- Question:
Jane is trying to decide whether to buy a house or a trailer. A house costs $480,000 and a trailer costs $120,000. Each loan will be paid in monthly installments over 20 years. How much more is the monthly payment on the house compared to the trailer? 
Answer:
1500 
Response:
<reasoning>
To compare the monthly payments for both the house and the trailer, we will calculate the monthly payments for each and then find the difference. We assume the following for simplicity:

1. **Loan Amounts:**
   - House: $480,000
   - Trailer: $120,000

2. **Loan Term:** 20 years = 240 months

3. **Interest Rate:** Without explicit information on the interest rate, we typically use a common mortgage rate when evaluating scenarios like this. However, without specific information, we might use a hypothetical interest rate for demonstration purposes. Let's assume a common mortgage interest rate of 4% per annum (0.04/12 per month) for both loans. 

The formula to calculate the monthly payment \( M \) for a loan is given by:

\[
M = P \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal loan amount,
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of payments.

Let's calculate the monthly payment for both the house and the trailer using this formula.

**Step-by-step Calculations:**

1. **Calculate \( r \):**  
   The annual interest rate is 4%, so the monthly interest rate \( r \) is:  
   \[
   r = \frac{0.04}{12} = 0.003333\ldots
   \]

2. **Calculate \( n \):**  
   The loan term is 20 years, so \( n \) is:  
   \[
   n = 20 \times 12 = 240
   \]

3. **Monthly Payment for the House:**  
   \[
   M_{\text{house}} = 480,000 \times \frac{0.003333\ldots(1 + 0.003333\ldots)^{240}}{(1 + 0.003

Janet pays $40/hour for 3 hours per week of clarinet lessons and $28/hour for 5 hours a week of piano lessons. How much more does she spend on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year? 
Answer:
1040 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how much more Janet spends on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year, we need to calculate her weekly and then annual spending for each type of lesson, and then compare the two.

1. **Clarinet Lessons:**
   - Janet pays $40 per hour for clarinet lessons.
   - She has 3 hours of clarinet lessons per week.
   - Weekly cost for clarinet lessons = $40/hour * 3 hours/week = $120/week.
   - Annual cost for clarinet lessons = $120/week * 52 weeks/year = $6,240/year.

2. **Piano Lessons:**
   - Janet pays $28 per hour for piano lessons.
   - She has 5 hours of piano lessons per week.
   - Weekly cost for piano lessons = $28/hour * 5 hours/week = $140/week.
   - Annual cost for piano lessons = $140/week * 52 weeks/year = $7,280/year.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Difference in annual spending = Annual cost for piano lessons - Annual cost for clarinet lessons.
   - Difference = $7,280/year - $6,240/year = $1,040/year.

Janet spends $1,040 more on piano lessons than on clarinet lessons in a year.

Sabrina is collecting herbs to make a poultice for her grandmother. She needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves and 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. If she needs 12 basil leaves, how many leaves total does she need? 
Answer:
29 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out the total number of leaves Sabrina needs, we will go through the relationships and values step by step.

1. **Determine the number of sage leaves:**
   - Sabrina needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves.
   - She has 12 basil leaves.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of sage leaves.
   - From the problem, we know: 
     \[
     2S = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{12}{2} = 6
     \]

2. **Determine the number of verbena leaves:**
   - Sabrina needs 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. Assume \( V \) is the number of verbena leaves.
   - Given that she needs 6 sage leaves, we have:
     \[
     S = V - 5
     \]
   - Substitute \( S = 6 \) into the equation:
     \[
     6 = V - 5
     \]
   - Solving for \( V \):
     \[
     V = 6 + 5 = 11
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of leaves:**
   - Sabrina collects three types of leaves: basil, sage, and verbena.
   - Total number of leaves is the sum of basil, sage, and verbena leaves:
     \[
     \text{Total leaves} = \text{Basil leaves} + \text{Sage leaves} + \text{Verbena leaves}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total leaves} = 12 + 6 + 11 = 29
     \]

Thus, the total number of leaves Sabrina needs is 29.

Over the past five years, on July 4th, the high temperature for Washington, DC has been: 90 degrees in 2020, 90 degrees in 2019, 90 degrees in 2018, 79 degrees in 2017 and 71 degrees in 2016. What is the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past 5 years? 
Answer:
84 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the specified years, we need to calculate the mean of the high temperatures listed for each of those years.

Here are the high temperatures for each year:
- 2020: 90 degrees
- 2019: 90 degrees
- 2018: 90 degrees
- 2017: 79 degrees
- 2016: 71 degrees

To calculate the average (mean) temperature, we sum all the temperatures and then divide by the number of years (which is 5 in this case).

1. Sum the temperatures:
   \[
   90 + 90 + 90 + 79 + 71 = 420
   \]

2. Divide the sum by the number of years:
   \[
   \frac{420}{5} = 84
   \]

Thus, the average temperature for July 4th over the past five years is 84 degrees.

Rene can finish reading 30 pages in 60 minutes. Lulu can read 27 pages in 60 minutes and Cherry can read 25 pages in 60 minutes. If they have been reading for 240 minutes now, how many pages have they finished reading in total? 
Answer:
328 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how many pages the three people have read in total, we first determine the reading rate of each person:

1. **Rene's reading rate**: 
   - Rene reads 30 pages in 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, Rene reads \( \frac{30 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.5 \text{ pages per minute} \).

2. **Lulu's reading rate**: 
   - Lulu reads 27 pages in 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, Lulu reads \( \frac{27 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.45 \text{ pages per minute} \).

3. **Cherry's reading rate**: 
   - Cherry reads 25 pages in 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, Cherry reads \( \frac{25 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.4167 \text{ pages per minute} \).

Next, we calculate how many pages each one has read in 240 minutes:

1. **Pages Rene read**: 
   - Rene reads \( 0.5 \text{ pages per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ pages} \).

2. **Pages Lulu read**: 
   - Lulu reads \( 0.45 \text{ pages per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 108 \text{ pages} \).

3. **Pages Cherry read**: 
   - Cherry reads \( 0.4167 \text{ pages per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} \approx 100 \text{ pages} \).

Finally, we sum the total pages read by all three:

- Total pages read = \( 120 \text{ pages} + 108 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 328 \text{ pages} \).

-------------------- Question:
Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than 1/3 as often as the big bell. If he rings both of them a combined total of 52 times, how many times does he ring the big bell? 
Answer:
36 
Response:
To solve this problem, let's define some variables:

- Let \( x \) be the number of times the big bell is rung.
- According to the problem, Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than \(\frac{1}{3}\) as often as the big bell. Therefore, the number of times the small bell is rung is \(\frac{x}{3} + 4\).

We are also given that the total number of rings for both bells is 52. This can be expressed as:

\[
x + \left(\frac{x}{3} + 4\right) = 52
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
x + \frac{x}{3} + 4 = 52
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\[
x + \frac{x}{3} = 48
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 3:

\[
3x + x = 144
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
4x = 144
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 36
\]

Thus, the number of times the big bell is rung is 36.

<reasoning>
We defined \( x \) as the number of times the big bell is rung. The small bell is rung \(\frac{x}{3} + 4\) times. We set up the equation based on the total number of rings, \( x + \left(\frac{x}{3} + 4\right) = 52 \). Simplifying and solving the equation led us to find \( x = 36 \).

Bert fills out the daily crossword puzzle in the newspaper every day. He uses up a pencil to fill out the puzzles every two weeks. On average, it takes him 1050 words to use up a pencil. How many words are in each crossword puzzle on average? 
Answer:
75 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how many words are in each crossword puzzle on average, we need to establish the total number of words Bert writes in two weeks and then determine the average number of words per day.

1. **Total Words in Two Weeks:** We know that it takes Bert 1050 words to use up a pencil over a two-week period. This means he writes 1050 words every 14 days.

2. **Average Words per Day:** To find the average number of words he writes per day, we divide the total number of words by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Average words per day} = \frac{1050 \text{ words}}{14 \text{ days}} = 75 \text{ words per day}
   \]

Therefore, on average, each crossword puzzle contains 75 words.

-------------------- Question:
Matt can make a batch of a dozen cookies using 2 pounds of flour.  He uses 4 bags of flour each weighing 5 pounds.  If Jim eats 15 cookies how many cookies are left? 
Answer:
105 
Response:
<reasoning>
1. First, we determine how many cookies can be made from 4 bags of flour. Each bag weighs 5 pounds, so 4 bags weigh:
   \[
   4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ pounds of flour}
   \]

2. According to the problem, Matt can make a dozen (12) cookies with 2 pounds of flour. Therefore, the number of dozens of cookies he can make with 20 pounds of flour can be calculated by finding out how many 2-pound portions are in 20 pounds:
   \[
   \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ dozens of cookies}
   \]

3. Since one dozen equals 12 cookies, 10 dozens of cookies is:
   \[
   10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ cookies}
   \]

4. Jim eats 15 cookies, so the number of cookies remaining is:
   \[
   120 - 15 = 105 \text{ cookies}
   \]
</reasoning>

<answer>
105 cookies are left.

-------------------- Question:
James decides to build a tin house by collecting 500 tins in a week. On the first day, he collects 50 tins. On the second day, he manages to collect 3 times that number. On the third day, he collects 50 tins fewer than the number he collected on the second day. If he collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days of the week, what's the number of tins he collected each day for the rest of the week? 
Answer:
50 
Response:
<reasoning>
1. Let's summarize James's tin collection for each day:
   - Day 1: James collects 50 tins.
   - Day 2: James collects 3 times the number he collected on Day 1. Therefore, he collects \(3 \times 50 = 150\) tins.
   - Day 3: James collects 50 tins fewer than he did on Day 2. Therefore, he collects \(150 - 50 = 100\) tins.

2. Now, let's calculate the total number of tins collected over the first three days:
   \[
   50 \ (\text{Day 1}) + 150 \ (\text{Day 2}) + 100 \ (\text{Day 3}) = 300 \ \text{tins}
   \]

3. James has a goal of collecting 500 tins in a week. Therefore, the number of tins remaining to be collected over the next four days is:
   \[
   500 - 300 = 200 \ \text{tins}
   \]

4. Since he collects an equal number of tins on each of the remaining four days, let \(x\) be the number of tins collected each of those days. Therefore, we have the equation:
   \[
   4x = 200
   \]

5. Solving for \(x\), we find:
   \[
   x = \frac{200}{4} = 50
   \]

Therefore, James collects 50 tins each day for the remaining four days of the week.

A jar of jellybeans has 14 blue jellybeans, 26 purple jellybeans and 40 orange jellybeans. If there are 200 jellybeans in the jar, how many are there of the red color? 
Answer:
120 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how many red jellybeans are in the jar, we first need to determine the total number of blue, purple, and orange jellybeans. According to the problem:

- Number of blue jellybeans = 14
- Number of purple jellybeans = 26
- Number of orange jellybeans = 40

First, we calculate the total number of blue, purple, and orange jellybeans by summing these amounts:

\[
14 \, (\text{blue}) + 26 \, (\text{purple}) + 40 \, (\text{orange}) = 80
\]

This means there are 80 jellybeans that are either blue, purple, or orange.

The problem states there are 200 jellybeans in total in the jar. To find out how many jellybeans are red, we subtract the number of blue, purple, and orange jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:

\[
200 \, (\text{total}) - 80 \, (\text{blue, purple, orange}) = 120
\]

Thus, there are 120 red jellybeans in the jar.

Five adults and two children go to see a movie and buy $12 worth of concessions. The total cost of their trip is $76. If each child's ticket is $7, how much, in dollars, are the adult tickets? 
Answer:
10 
Response:
<reasoning>
First, let's determine the total cost of the children's tickets. There are two children, and each child's ticket costs $7. Therefore, the total cost for the children's tickets is:

\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know the total cost of the trip is $76, and $12 of this is for concessions. Therefore, the total cost for the movie tickets is:

\[ 76 - 12 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, subtract the cost of the children's tickets from the total ticket cost to find the cost of the adults' tickets:

\[ 64 - 14 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

There are five adults, and the total cost for their tickets is $50. Therefore, the cost of each adult ticket is:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each adult ticket costs $10.

Janelle had 26 green marbles. Then she bought 6 bags of blue marbles. There were 10 marbles in each bag.  She created a gift of 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles and gave it to a friend. How many marbles does Janelle have now? 
Answer:
72 
Response:
<reasoning>
1. Start by finding the total number of blue marbles Janelle bought. She bought 6 bags with 10 marbles in each bag, so the total number of blue marbles is:
   \[
   6 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ marbles per bag} = 60 \text{ blue marbles}
   \]

2. Calculate Janelle's initial total number of marbles. She had 26 green marbles and bought 60 blue marbles, so initially, she had:
   \[
   26 \text{ green marbles} + 60 \text{ blue marbles} = 86 \text{ marbles}
   \]

3. Determine how many marbles Janelle gave away as a gift. She gave away 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles, so the total number of marbles given away is:
   \[
   6 \text{ green marbles} + 8 \text{ blue marbles} = 14 \text{ marbles}
   \]

4. Subtract the number of marbles given away from the initial total to find how many marbles Janelle has now:
   \[
   86 \text{ marbles} - 14 \text{ marbles} = 72 \text{ marbles}
   \]

-------------------- Question:
Every day in a week, Siena bookmarks 30 website pages from the research she does on her browser. If Siena has 400 bookmarked pages on her bookmarks library now, how many pages will she have in her bookmarks library at the end of March? 
Answer:
1330 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many days are there until the end of March and how many pages Siena will bookmark during that time. We also need to consider the number of bookmarks she already has.

1. **Determine the Total Number of Days Remaining in March:**
   - As of the start of March, there are 31 days in the month.
   - If Siena currently has 400 bookmarked pages, we need to determine the date to calculate the remaining days in March.
   - Let's assume Siena starts counting "starting from now" implies today is March 1st for calculation purposes (we will verify the result later since the exact start date is not specified).

2. **Calculate the Remaining Days:**
   - From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days total.
   - If today is March 1st, all 31 days of March will be considered for adding bookmarks.

3. **Calculate the Additional Bookmarks Added in March:**
   - Siena bookmarks 30 pages each day.
   - In 31 days, the total number of additional bookmarks she will add is:
     \[
     31 \text{ days} \times 30 \text{ pages/day} = 930 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Bookmarked Pages by the End of March:**
   - Siena currently has 400 bookmarked pages.
   - Adding the bookmarks she will add in March:
     \[
     400 \text{ pages} + 930 \text{ pages} = 1330 \text{ pages}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Assuming the problem starts counting from March 1st, Siena will have 1330 bookmarked pages by the end of March.
   - If the starting day were different, the number of days and thus the final page count would need recalculating. However, without specific start date information, assuming March 1st for calculation is reasonable.

An old pirate wants to leave his treasure on an island. He has 3500 gold coins. He wants to spread this equally across 5 chests. Additionally, he will put a total of 500 silver coins and twice as many bronze coins as silver, all distributed equally across the chests. How many coins in total will be in each chest? 
Answer:
1000 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the total number of coins in each chest, we need to calculate the distribution of gold, silver, and bronze coins.

1. **Gold Coins:**
   - Total gold coins = 3500
   - These are to be distributed equally into 5 chests.
   - Gold coins per chest = 3500 / 5 = 700

2. **Silver Coins:**
   - Total silver coins = 500
   - These are to be distributed equally into 5 chests.
   - Silver coins per chest = 500 / 5 = 100

3. **Bronze Coins:**
   - The number of bronze coins is twice the number of silver coins.
   - Total bronze coins = 2 * 500 = 1000
   - These are to be distributed equally into 5 chests.
   - Bronze coins per chest = 1000 / 5 = 200

4. **Total Coins per Chest:**
   - Total coins per chest = Gold coins per chest + Silver coins per chest + Bronze coins per chest
   - Total coins per chest = 700 + 100 + 200 = 1000

On Wednesday he baked three times the number of cookies he did on Tuesday, but his brother ate 4 of those cookies. How many cookies did he have at the end of the three days? 
Answer:
92 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how many cookies Zach had at the end of the three days, we need to calculate the number of cookies he baked each day and account for the cookies his brother ate.

1. **Monday**: Zach baked 32 cookies.

2. **Tuesday**: Zach ran out of sugar and could only bake half of the number of cookies he baked on Monday. 
   \[
   \text{Cookies on Tuesday} = \frac{32}{2} = 16
   \]

3. **Wednesday**: Zach baked three times the number of cookies he did on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Cookies baked on Wednesday} = 3 \times 16 = 48
   \]
   However, his brother ate 4 of those cookies, so the number of cookies left from Wednesday's batch is:
   \[
   48 - 4 = 44
   \]

4. **Total cookies at the end of three days**: 
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = 32 \, (\text{Monday}) + 16 \, (\text{Tuesday}) + 44 \, (\text{Wednesday}) = 92
   \]

Therefore, Zach had 92 cookies at the end of the three days.

Mark and James need a total of 14 dice that are 12 sided to play their game.  Mark has a bag of 10 dice and 60% of them are 12 sided.  James has a bag of 8 dice and 75% of them are 12 sided.  How many dice will the boys need to buy to play their game? 
Answer:
2 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how many dice the boys need to buy, we first calculate how many 12-sided dice they currently have.

1. **Mark's Dice:**
   - Mark has 10 dice.
   - 60% of Mark's dice are 12-sided.
   - Calculation: \(10 \times 0.60 = 6\) dice are 12-sided.

2. **James's Dice:**
   - James has 8 dice.
   - 75% of James's dice are 12-sided.
   - Calculation: \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) dice are 12-sided.

3. **Total 12-sided Dice:**
   - Mark's 12-sided dice = 6.
   - James's 12-sided dice = 6.
   - Combined total = \(6 + 6 = 12\) dice.

4. **Dice Needed:**
   - They need a total of 14 12-sided dice to play.
   - They currently have 12.
   - Dice they need to buy = \(14 - 12 = 2\).
