-------------------- Question:
A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all? 
Answer:
476 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how much Mr. Benson paid, we need to calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets and then apply the discount for the remaining 2 tickets.

1. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets:**
   - Each ticket costs $40.
   - Therefore, the cost for 10 tickets is \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the additional 2 tickets with a discount:**
   - Normally, each ticket costs $40.
   - He receives a 5% discount for each ticket beyond the 10th.
   - The discount per ticket is \(5\% \times 40 = 0.05 \times 40 = 2\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the discounted price per ticket is \(40 - 2 = 38\) dollars.
   - The cost for 2 discounted tickets is \(2 \times 38 = 76\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   - Add the cost of the first 10 tickets and the cost of the discounted 2 tickets:  
   \(400 + 76 = 476\) dollars.

Thus, Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for all 12 tickets.

-------------------- Question:
Jane is trying to decide whether to buy a house or a trailer. A house costs $480,000 and a trailer costs $120,000. Each loan will be paid in monthly installments over 20 years. How much more is the monthly payment on the house compared to the trailer? 
Answer:
1500 
Response:
<reasoning>
To compare the monthly payments for both the house and the trailer, we will calculate the monthly payments for each and then find the difference. We assume the following for simplicity:

1. **Loan Amounts:**
   - House: $480,000
   - Trailer: $120,000

2. **Loan Term:** 20 years = 240 months

3. **Interest Rate:** Without explicit information on the interest rate, we typically use a common mortgage rate when evaluating scenarios like this. However, without specific information, we might use a hypothetical interest rate for demonstration purposes. Let's assume a common mortgage interest rate of 4% per annum (0.04/12 per month) for both loans. 

The formula to calculate the monthly payment \( M \) for a loan is given by:

\[
M = P \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal loan amount,
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of payments.

Let's calculate the monthly payment for both the house and the trailer using this formula.

**Step-by-step Calculations:**

1. **Calculate \( r \):**  
   The annual interest rate is 4%, so the monthly interest rate \( r \) is:  
   \[
   r = \frac{0.04}{12} = 0.003333\ldots
   \]

2. **Calculate \( n \):**  
   The loan term is 20 years, so \( n \) is:  
   \[
   n = 20 \times 12 = 240
   \]

3. **Monthly Payment for the House:**  
   \[
   M_{\text{house}} = 480,000 \times \frac{0.003333\ldots(1 + 0.003333\ldots)^{240}}{(1 + 0.003

Janet pays $40/hour for 3 hours per week of clarinet lessons and $28/hour for 5 hours a week of piano lessons. How much more does she spend on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year? 
Answer:
1040 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how much more Janet spends on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year, we need to calculate her weekly and then annual spending for each type of lesson, and then compare the two.

1. **Clarinet Lessons:**
   - Janet pays $40 per hour for clarinet lessons.
   - She has 3 hours of clarinet lessons per week.
   - Weekly cost for clarinet lessons = $40/hour * 3 hours/week = $120/week.
   - Annual cost for clarinet lessons = $120/week * 52 weeks/year = $6,240/year.

2. **Piano Lessons:**
   - Janet pays $28 per hour for piano lessons.
   - She has 5 hours of piano lessons per week.
   - Weekly cost for piano lessons = $28/hour * 5 hours/week = $140/week.
   - Annual cost for piano lessons = $140/week * 52 weeks/year = $7,280/year.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Difference in annual spending = Annual cost for piano lessons - Annual cost for clarinet lessons.
   - Difference = $7,280/year - $6,240/year = $1,040/year.

Janet spends $1,040 more on piano lessons than on clarinet lessons in a year.

Sabrina is collecting herbs to make a poultice for her grandmother. She needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves and 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. If she needs 12 basil leaves, how many leaves total does she need? 
Answer:
29 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out the total number of leaves Sabrina needs, we will go through the relationships and values step by step.

1. **Determine the number of sage leaves:**
   - Sabrina needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves.
   - She has 12 basil leaves.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of sage leaves.
   - From the problem, we know: 
     \[
     2S = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{12}{2} = 6
     \]

2. **Determine the number of verbena leaves:**
   - Sabrina needs 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. Assume \( V \) is the number of verbena leaves.
   - Given that she needs 6 sage leaves, we have:
     \[
     S = V - 5
     \]
   - Substitute \( S = 6 \) into the equation:
     \[
     6 = V - 5
     \]
   - Solving for \( V \):
     \[
     V = 6 + 5 = 11
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of leaves:**
   - Sabrina collects three types of leaves: basil, sage, and verbena.
   - Total number of leaves is the sum of basil, sage, and verbena leaves:
     \[
     \text{Total leaves} = \text{Basil leaves} + \text{Sage leaves} + \text{Verbena leaves}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total leaves} = 12 + 6 + 11 = 29
     \]

Thus, the total number of leaves Sabrina needs is 29.

Over the past five years, on July 4th, the high temperature for Washington, DC has been: 90 degrees in 2020, 90 degrees in 2019, 90 degrees in 2018, 79 degrees in 2017 and 71 degrees in 2016. What is the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past 5 years? 
Answer:
84 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the specified years, we need to calculate the mean of the high temperatures listed for each of those years.

Here are the high temperatures for each year:
- 2020: 90 degrees
- 2019: 90 degrees
- 2018: 90 degrees
- 2017: 79 degrees
- 2016: 71 degrees

To calculate the average (mean) temperature, we sum all the temperatures and then divide by the number of years (which is 5 in this case).

1. Sum the temperatures:
   \[
   90 + 90 + 90 + 79 + 71 = 420
   \]

2. Divide the sum by the number of years:
   \[
   \frac{420}{5} = 84
   \]

Thus, the average temperature for July 4th over the past five years is 84 degrees.

Rene can finish reading 30 pages in 60 minutes. Lulu can read 27 pages in 60 minutes and Cherry can read 25 pages in 60 minutes. If they have been reading for 240 minutes now, how many pages have they finished reading in total? 
Answer:
328 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how many pages the three people have read in total, we first determine the reading rate of each person:

1. **Rene's reading rate**: 
   - Rene reads 30 pages in 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, Rene reads \( \frac{30 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.5 \text{ pages per minute} \).

2. **Lulu's reading rate**: 
   - Lulu reads 27 pages in 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, Lulu reads \( \frac{27 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.45 \text{ pages per minute} \).

3. **Cherry's reading rate**: 
   - Cherry reads 25 pages in 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, Cherry reads \( \frac{25 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.4167 \text{ pages per minute} \).

Next, we calculate how many pages each one has read in 240 minutes:

1. **Pages Rene read**: 
   - Rene reads \( 0.5 \text{ pages per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ pages} \).

2. **Pages Lulu read**: 
   - Lulu reads \( 0.45 \text{ pages per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 108 \text{ pages} \).

3. **Pages Cherry read**: 
   - Cherry reads \( 0.4167 \text{ pages per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} \approx 100 \text{ pages} \).

Finally, we sum the total pages read by all three:

- Total pages read = \( 120 \text{ pages} + 108 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 328 \text{ pages} \).

-------------------- Question:
Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than 1/3 as often as the big bell. If he rings both of them a combined total of 52 times, how many times does he ring the big bell? 
Answer:
36 
Response:
To solve this problem, let's define some variables:

- Let \( x \) be the number of times the big bell is rung.
- According to the problem, Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than \(\frac{1}{3}\) as often as the big bell. Therefore, the number of times the small bell is rung is \(\frac{x}{3} + 4\).

We are also given that the total number of rings for both bells is 52. This can be expressed as:

\[
x + \left(\frac{x}{3} + 4\right) = 52
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
x + \frac{x}{3} + 4 = 52
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\[
x + \frac{x}{3} = 48
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 3:

\[
3x + x = 144
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
4x = 144
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 36
\]

Thus, the number of times the big bell is rung is 36.

<reasoning>
We defined \( x \) as the number of times the big bell is rung. The small bell is rung \(\frac{x}{3} + 4\) times. We set up the equation based on the total number of rings, \( x + \left(\frac{x}{3} + 4\right) = 52 \). Simplifying and solving the equation led us to find \( x = 36 \).

Bert fills out the daily crossword puzzle in the newspaper every day. He uses up a pencil to fill out the puzzles every two weeks. On average, it takes him 1050 words to use up a pencil. How many words are in each crossword puzzle on average? 
Answer:
75 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how many words are in each crossword puzzle on average, we need to establish the total number of words Bert writes in two weeks and then determine the average number of words per day.

1. **Total Words in Two Weeks:** We know that it takes Bert 1050 words to use up a pencil over a two-week period. This means he writes 1050 words every 14 days.

2. **Average Words per Day:** To find the average number of words he writes per day, we divide the total number of words by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Average words per day} = \frac{1050 \text{ words}}{14 \text{ days}} = 75 \text{ words per day}
   \]

Therefore, on average, each crossword puzzle contains 75 words.

-------------------- Question:
Matt can make a batch of a dozen cookies using 2 pounds of flour.  He uses 4 bags of flour each weighing 5 pounds.  If Jim eats 15 cookies how many cookies are left? 
Answer:
105 
Response:
<reasoning>
1. First, determine how much flour Matt has in total. The problem states that he uses 4 bags of flour, each weighing 5 pounds. Therefore, the total amount of flour is:
   \[
   4 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ pounds/bag} = 20 \text{ pounds of flour}
   \]

2. Next, determine how many batches of cookies Matt can make with the flour. Since 1 batch requires 2 pounds of flour, we compute:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ pounds of flour}}{2 \text{ pounds/batch}} = 10 \text{ batches}
   \]

3. Each batch makes a dozen cookies, which is 12 cookies per batch. Therefore, the total number of cookies Matt can make is:
   \[
   10 \text{ batches} \times 12 \text{ cookies/batch} = 120 \text{ cookies}
   \]

4. Jim eats 15 cookies. To find out how many cookies are left, subtract the number of cookies Jim ate from the total number of cookies:
   \[
   120 \text{ cookies} - 15 \text{ cookies} = 105 \text{ cookies}
   \]

</reasoning>
<answer>
105 cookies are left.

-------------------- Question:
James decides to build a tin house by collecting 500 tins in a week. On the first day, he collects 50 tins. On the second day, he manages to collect 3 times that number. On the third day, he collects 50 tins fewer than the number he collected on the second day. If he collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days of the week, what's the number of tins he collected each day for the rest of the week? 
Answer:
50 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's break down the tin collection over the week based on the information provided:

1. **Day 1**: James collects 50 tins.
   
2. **Day 2**: He collects 3 times the number from Day 1.  
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ tins}
   \]

3. **Day 3**: He collects 50 tins fewer than Day 2.  
   \[
   150 - 50 = 100 \text{ tins}
   \]

Now, we calculate the total number of tins collected in the first three days:
\[
50 + 150 + 100 = 300 \text{ tins}
\]

James aims to collect 500 tins in total for the week. Therefore, the remaining number of tins to be collected over the last four days is:
\[
500 - 300 = 200 \text{ tins}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the number of tins collected each day for the remaining four days. According to the problem:
\[
4x = 200
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{200}{4} = 50
\]

So, James collected 50 tins each day for the remaining four days.

James collected 50 tins each day for the remaining four days.

A jar of jellybeans has 14 blue jellybeans, 26 purple jellybeans and 40 orange jellybeans. If there are 200 jellybeans in the jar, how many are there of the red color? 
Answer:
120 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the number of red jellybeans in the jar, we first need to calculate the total number of jellybeans of known colors. We know there are:
- 14 blue jellybeans
- 26 purple jellybeans
- 40 orange jellybeans

Let's add these numbers to find how many jellybeans are accounted for by these colors:

\[ 14 \, (\text{blue}) + 26 \, (\text{purple}) + 40 \, (\text{orange}) = 80 \]

Next, we know the total number of jellybeans in the jar is 200. To find the number of red jellybeans, we subtract the number of jellybeans of known colors from the total:

\[ 200 \, (\text{total jellybeans}) - 80 \, (\text{blue, purple, and orange jellybeans}) = 120 \]

Thus, there are 120 red jellybeans in the jar.

Five adults and two children go to see a movie and buy $12 worth of concessions. The total cost of their trip is $76. If each child's ticket is $7, how much, in dollars, are the adult tickets? 
Answer:
10 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the trip for five adults and two children is $76.
2. The cost for concessions is $12.
3. Therefore, the total cost for the movie tickets alone is \(76 - 12 = 64\) dollars.
4. We know that each child's ticket costs $7, and there are two children, so the total cost for the children's tickets is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) dollars.
5. Subtracting the cost of the children's tickets from the total ticket cost gives us the cost for the adult tickets: \(64 - 14 = 50\) dollars.
6. There are five adults, so the cost of one adult ticket is \(\frac{50}{5} = 10\) dollars.

Thus, the cost of each adult ticket is $10.

Janelle had 26 green marbles. Then she bought 6 bags of blue marbles. There were 10 marbles in each bag.  She created a gift of 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles and gave it to a friend. How many marbles does Janelle have now? 
Answer:
72 
Response:
<reasoning>
1. Initially, Janelle has 26 green marbles.
2. She buys 6 bags of blue marbles, with each bag containing 10 marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles she buys is:
   \[
   6 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ marbles/bag} = 60 \text{ blue marbles}
   \]
3. After buying the blue marbles, Janelle has:
   - 26 green marbles
   - 60 blue marbles

4. Janelle then creates a gift consisting of 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles and gives it to a friend. The remaining number of each type of marble will be:
   - Green marbles remaining: \(26 - 6 = 20\) green marbles
   - Blue marbles remaining: \(60 - 8 = 52\) blue marbles

5. The total number of marbles Janelle has now is the sum of the remaining green and blue marbles:
   \[
   20 \text{ green marbles} + 52 \text{ blue marbles} = 72 \text{ marbles}

Answer:
1330 
Response:
<reasoning>
1. First, establish the initial condition: Siena currently has 400 bookmarked pages.

2. Determine the rate at which Siena adds bookmarks: She adds 30 pages every day.

3. Identify the period over which to calculate the new bookmarks from now until the end of March. We assume the current date is the beginning of March, as the exact date in March is not specified in the problem. For calculation, let's assume itâ€™s March 1st.

4. Determine the number of days in March. March has 31 days.

5. Calculate how many days Siena will bookmark pages in March, starting from March 1st to March 31st, which is 31 days.

6. Calculate the total number of new bookmarks added in March:  
   \(30 \times 31 = 930\) pages.

7. Add the new pages to the existing pages to find the total number of bookmarked pages at the end of March:
