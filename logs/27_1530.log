-------------------- Question:
A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all? 
Answer:
476 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine the total amount Mr. Benson paid for the concert tickets, we need to apply the discount to tickets he bought beyond the first 1æ£’10 tickets. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step calculation:

1. Calculate the cost of the first 1æ£’0 tickets without discount. Since each ticket costs $40:
   \[
   10 \times 40 = 400
   \]

2. Determine the number of tickets bought after the initial 1æ£’0 tickets:
   \[
   12 - 10 = 2
   \]

3. Calculate the cost of the additional 2 tickets with the discount applied. Each of these tickets gets a 5% discount:
   \[
   40 \times (1 - 0.05) = 40 \times 0.95 = 38
   \]
   Thus, the total cost for the 2

-------------------- Question:
Jane is trying to decide whether to buy a house or a trailer. A house costs $480,000 and a trailer costs $120,000. Each loan will be paid in monthly installments over 20 years. How much more is the monthly payment on the house compared to the trailer? 
Answer:
1500 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the monthly payments for both the house and the trailer using the loan formula for a fixed-rate payment over a fixed period. The formula for a fixed-rate loan payment is:

\[
M = P \frac{r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n - 1}
\]

Where:
- \( M \) is the monthly payment.
- \( P \) is the principal, which is the loan amount.
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12).
- \( n \) is the number of payments (loan term in months).

Given the information, the principal \( P \) for both the house and the trailer is $480,000 and $120,000, respectively. Since no annual interest rate is provided and it's common to consider an average interest rate of around 4% for such loans

Janet pays $40/hour for 3 hours per week of clarinet lessons and $28/hour for 5 hours a week of piano lessons. How much more does she spend on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year? 
Answer:
1040 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how much more Janet spends on piano lessons than on clarinet lessons in a year, we need to calculate the weekly cost for each type of lesson, then find the annual cost for each, and finally subtract the weekly clarinet cost from the weekly piano cost to find the difference.

First, we calculate the weekly cost for clarinet lessons:
- Weekly clarinet lesson cost: $40/hour * 3 hours/week

Next, we calculate the weekly cost for piano lessons:
- Weekly piano lesson cost: $28/hour * 5 hours/week

Subtract the weekly clarinet lesson cost from the weekly piano lesson cost to find the weekly difference in cost.

Finally, multiply the weekly difference in cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks) to find the annual difference in cost.

-------------------- Question:
Sabrina is collecting herbs to make a poultice for her grandmother. She needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves and 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. If she needs 12 basil leaves, how many leaves total does she need? 
Answer:
29 
Response:
<reasoning>
Sabrina needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves. If she has 12 basil leaves, that means the number of sage leaves required is half of the number of basil leaves. The difference in the number of sage leaves and verbena leaves is 5. Therefore, we can calculate the number of sage leaves first and then find out the number of verbena leaves needed. Finally, we sum up all the leaves to get the total number needed.

Sage leaves = Basil leaves / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6
Verbena leaves = Sage leaves + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11

Total leaves = Basil leaves + Sage leaves + Verbena leaves
Total leaves = 12 + 6 + 11
Total leaves = 29

</reasoning>
<answer>
Sabrina needs a total of 29 leaves. </answer>
