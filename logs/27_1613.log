-------------------- Question:
A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all? 
Answer:
476 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, first, we need to calculate the cost of each ticket after the discount. Since Mr. Benson bought more than 10 tickets (12), he gets a 5% discount on any ticket bought above 10. 

He buys 12 tickets, so he gets a discount on the 12 - 10 = 2 extra tickets. Each of these 2 extra tickets has the discount of 40 * 0.05 = $2. Hence, the total discount for these 2 tickets is 2 * $2 = $4.

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount: 12 tickets * $40 = $480. Then we subtract the discount received: $480 - $4 = $476. Thus, Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for the 12 concert tickets.

Over the past five years, on July 4th, the high temperature for Washington, DC has been: 90 degrees in 2020, 90 degrees in 2019, 90 degrees in 2018, 79 degrees in 2017 and 71 degrees in 2016. What is the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past 5 years? 
Answer:
84 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the average temperature over the past five years, we need to perform the following steps:
1. Sum up all the recorded temperatures.
2. Divide the sum by the number of years (5 in this case).

Let's calculate it step by step.
The recorded temperatures are 90, 90, 90, 79, and 71 degrees Fahrenheit.
The sum of these temperatures is:
90 + 90 + 90 + 79 + 71 = 410 degrees Fahrenheit.

Now, to find the average temperature, we divide the sum by the number of years:
410 / 5 = 82 degrees Fahrenheit.

Matt can make a batch of a dozen cookies using 2 pounds of flour.  He uses 4 bags of flour each weighing 5 pounds.  If Jim eats 15 cookies how many cookies are left? 
Answer:
105 
Response:
<reasoning>
First, let's determine how much flour Matt has. Matt uses 4 bags of flour, where each bag weighs 5 pounds. 
\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bag} = 20 \text{ pounds of flour} \]
Matt can make a batch of a dozen (12) cookies using 2 pounds of flour. With 20 pounds of flour, the number of batches he can make is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per batch}} = 10 \text{ batches} \]
Since each batch makes 12 cookies, the total number of cookies Matt can make is:
\[ 10 \text{ batches} \times 12 \text{ cookies per batch} = 120 \text{ cookies} \]
Jim eats 15 cookies, so the number of cookies left is:

Janelle had 26 green marbles. Then she bought 6 bags of blue marbles. There were 10 marbles in each bag.  She created a gift of 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles and gave it to a friend. How many marbles does Janelle have now? 
Answer:
72 
Response:
<reasoning>
Janelle starts with 26 green marbles. She bought 6 bags of blue marbles, with 10 marbles in each bag, resulting in a total of \(6 \times 10 = 60\) blue marbles. She then gave away 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles as a gift. Therefore, we subtract the 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles from the total she initially had to find out how many she has left.

Initial green marbles - given green marbles = \(26 - 6 = 20\) green marbles.
Initial blue marbles - given blue marbles = \(60 - 8 = 52\) blue marbles.
Total marbles left = \(20 + 52 = 72\).

Zach baked cookies for a bake sale. On Monday he baked 32 cookies. On Tuesday he ran out of sugar and could only bake half of the number of cookies he baked the day before. On Wednesday he baked three times the number of cookies he did on Tuesday, but his brother ate 4 of those cookies. How many cookies did he have at the end of the three days? 
Answer:
92 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how many cookies Zach had at the end of the three days, we need to calculate the number of cookies baked each day and then account for the cookies his brother ate.

1. **Monday**: Zach baked 32 cookies.
2. **Tuesday**: Zach baked half the number of cookies he baked on Monday. So he baked \( \frac{32}{2} = 16 \) cookies.
3. **Wednesday**: Zach baked three times the number of cookies he baked on Tuesday. So he baked \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) cookies. However, his brother ate 4 of those cookies. Therefore, Zach had \( 48 - 4 = 44 \) cookies left from Wednesday.

Finally, we sum the number of cookies from Monday, Tuesday, and the remaining cookies from Wednesday to find the total number of cookies Zach had at the end of the three days.

Andy walks 50 meters from his house to school. After school, he comes back to the house and goes to the market. If he walks 140 meters in total, how many meters is the distance between the house and the market? 
Answer:
40 
Response:
<reasoning>
Given:
- Andy walks 50 meters from his house to school.
- He also walks 50 meters back to his house after school.
- After the market, he walks a total of 140 meters.

Since he walks back from school to his house, the distance from the house to the school is 50 meters. Thus, the distance from his house to the market would be the same as from the house to the school, which is 5l0 meters.

However, since he has already walked 50 meters to the school, he needs to walk the remaining distance back to the house (which is 50 meters), and then to the market. This means the remaining distance after he leaves the house and goes to the market is 40 meters (140 meters total minus 10

Tony lifts weights as a form of exercise.  He can lift 90 pounds with one arm in the exercise known as "the curl."  In an exercise known as "the military press," he can lift over his head twice the weight that he can curl.  His favorite exercise is known as "the squat" and he can squat 5 times the weight that he can lift in the military press.  How much weight, in pounds, can Tony lift in the squat exercise? 
Answer:
900 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how much weight Tony can lift in the squat exercise, we need to follow this sequence of operations based on the information given:

1. First, calculate the weight Tony can lift in the "the military press" exercise. Since he can lift 90 pounds with one arm in the "the curl" exercise and "the military press" involves lifting over his head twice the weight of the "the curl," we have:
   \[
   \text{Military Press} = 2 \times 90 \text{ pounds} = 180 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Next, we use the weight lifted in the "the military press" to determine the weight he can lift in the "the squat" exercise. According to the problem, Tony can squat 5 times the weight he can lift in the "the military press":
   \[
   \text{Squat} = 5 \times \text{

-------------------- Question:
Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first? 
Answer:
17 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's denote the initial amount of money Michael's brother had as \(x\).

According resemble:
1. Michael gives away half of his money to his brother, so his brother receives $42 / 2 = $21.
2. His brother then buys $3 worth of candy, which leaves him with $35.
3. We need to determine the initial amount \(x\) his brother had.

If we denote the initial amount as \(x\), after purchasing the candy he still has $35, and we know he received $21 from his brother. Thus, we can set up the following equation to find \(x\):

\[ x - 3 = 35 \]

where the $3 is the cost of the candy.
 
Subtract 3 from 35 to find the initial amount \(x\):

\[ x - 3 = 35 \]
\[ x = 35 + 3 \]

Barry, Thomas and Emmanuel are to share a jar of 200 jelly beans. If Thomas takes 10%, and Barry and Emmanuel are to share the remainder in the ratio 4:5 respectively, how many jelly beans will Emmanuel get? 
Answer:
100 
Response:
<reasoning>
Barry, Thomas and Emmanuel share a jar of 200 jelly beans. Thomas takes 10% of the total jelly beans, which means he takes:
\[ \text{Thomas's portion} = 10\% \times 200 = 0.10 \times 200 = 20 \text{ jelly beans} \]

The remainder of the jelly beans after Thomas's portion is taken:
\[ \text{Remainder} = 200 - 20 = 180 \text{ jelly beans} \]

Barry and Emmanuel will share the remainder in the ratio 4:5. The total parts of the ratio for Barry and Emmanuel together is \(4 + 5 = 9\) parts.

The number of jelly beans in each part of the ratio is:

-------------------- Question:
Andy is a lawyer who's working on two lawsuits. The first lawsuit has a 30% chance of paying out $5,000,000 upon a win and $0 if he loses it. The second lawsuit has a 50% chance of paying out $1,000,000 if Andy loses and a 50% chance of paying out $2,000,000 if he wins.  Expressed as a percentage, how much more likely is it that Andy loses both lawsuits compared to winning both of them? 
Answer:
20 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how much more likely it is for Andy to lose both lawsuits compared to winning both of them, we need to calculate the probabilities of these events first. We will then determine the difference between them.

For the first lawsuit, there's a 30% (or 0.3) chance Andy will win and receive $5,000,000, and a 70% (or 0.7) chance he will lose and receive $0.

For the second lawsuit, there's a 50% (or 0.5) chance Andy will win and receive $2,000,000, and a 50% (or 0.5) chance he will lose and receive $1,000,000.

Now, we calculate the probability of winning both lawsuits by multiplying their respective probabilities:

John is half times younger than his father, who is 4 years older than John's mother. If John's father is 40 years old, what's the age difference between John and his mother? 
Answer:
16 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's break down the problem step-bychunk:

1. **Determine John's age**: Given John's father's age is 40 years, and John is half times younger than his father, this means John's age is half the age of his father. Thus, John's age = \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) years.

2. **Determine John's mother's age**: John's father is 4 years older than John's mother, so if John's father is 40 years old, John's mother's age = 40 - 4 = 36 years.

3. **Determine the age difference between John and his mother**: To find the age difference between John and his mother, subtract John's age from his mother's age: 36 - 20 = 16 years.

So, the age difference between John and his mother is 16 years.

-------------------- Question:
Lisa has decided to replace her old cutlery. As she is going through the cupboards, she sees the spoons from when each of her 4 children were babies as well as 2 decorative spoons she created. She doesn't want to get rid of any of these so she adds them to her new set of cutlery. The new set of cutlery has 10 large spoons and 15 teaspoons. If the children each had 3 spoons when they were babies, how many spoons does Lisa now have? 
Answer:
39 
Response:
<reasoning>
From the problem, we know the following:
- Lisa has 10 large spoons and 15 teaspoons in her new set of cutlery.
- Lisa has 4 children, and each child had 3 spoons during their babyhood, which means a total of \(4 \times 3 = 12\) baby spoons.
- Lisa also has 2 decorative spoons.

We want to find the total number of spoons Lisa has now. The total number of spoons can be calculated by summing up the baby spoons, decorative spoons, and the new set of cutlery spoons. We will then subtract the spoons she got rid of, which are the baby spoons.

So, the calculation would be:
\[ \text{Total spoons} = \text{Baby spoons} + \text{Decorative spoons} + \text{New spoons} - \text{Baby spoons}

Marites internet speed is 10 megabits per second and her monthly internet bill is $20. Marites is planning to upgrade her service and choosing between 20 Mbps and 30 Mbps. If the price of the 30 Mbps is twice the amount of her current monthly bill and the price of the 20 Mbps is $10 more than her current monthly bill, how much will she save per year if she chooses the 20 Mbps than 30 Mbps? 
Answer:
120 
Response:
<reasoning>
First, we calculate Marites' current monthly internet bill, which is $20. 

- For the 30 Mbps service, it is given that the price is twice her current monthly bill. Hence, the price for the 30 Mbps is 2 * $2格ranscendental = $40 per month.
  
- For the 20 Mbps service, it is given that the price is $10 more than her current monthly bill. Hence, the price for the 20 Mbps is $20 + $10 = $30 per month.

Next, we calculate the yearly bills for both options:
- For the 30 Mbps service: $40 * 12 months = $480 annually.
- For the 20 Mbps service: $30 * 12 months = $360 annually.

Suzie and 5 of her friends decide to rent an Airbnb at Lake Tahoe for 4 days from Thursday to Sunday. The rental rate for weekdays is $420 per day. The weekend rental rate is $540 per day. They all decide to split the rental evenly. How much does each person have to pay? 
Answer:
320 
Response:
<reasoning>
Suzie and her 5 friends make a total of 6 people. The Airbnb rental period is from Thursday to Sunday, so there are 2 weekdays (Thursday and Friday) and 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). 

First, calculate the total cost for the weekdays and the total cost for the weekend days separately:
- Cost for weekdays = $420/day * 2 days = $840.
- Cost for weekend days = $540/day * 2 days = $1080.

Then, sum up the total cost for the entire rental period:
- Total cost = $840 + $1080 = $1920.

Finally, divide the total cost by the number of people to find how much each person needs to pay:
- Cost per person = $1920 / 6 = $320.

Horatio is a poet composing sonnets for his lady fair. He believes it will take many of his sonnets to win her over. Each sonnet is fourteen lines long. His lady fair tells him to leave her alone after he reads her only seven sonnets, and Horatio is heartbroken over the 70 romantic lines he wrote that she never heard. How many sonnets did Horatio write in all? 
Answer:
12 
Response:
<reasoning>
Horatio's lady fair only had the opportunity to hear 7 sonnets out of the ones he wrote. Since each sonnet consists of 匹呂十四行 (14 lines), the total number of lines she heard is 7 sonnets * 14 lines/sonnet = 98 lines. 

However, she never heard the remaining 7 sonnets, which also consisted of 7 sonnets * 14 lines/sonnet = 98 lines.

So, the total number of lines Horatio wrote, which is equal to the total number of lines his lady fair never heard, is 98 lines + 98 lines = 196 lines.

Thus, Horatio wrote 196 lines in total, and if each sonnet has 14 lines, the total number of sonnets he wrote can be calculated by dividing the total lines by the lines per sonnet: 196 lines /

Answer:
12 
Response:
<reasoning>
We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the on intervals of the light bulbs which are 2 seconds, 3 seconds, and 4 seconds. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each number in the set. 

To find the LCM of 2, 3, and 4, we can use the prime factorization method. Prime factorizations are:
- 2 = 2
- 3 = 3
- 4 = 2 * 2

To find LCM, we take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorization. 
- The prime 2 appears in the factorizations as 2^1 and 2^2. So we take 2^2.
- The prime 3 appears as 3^1. So we take 3^1.

First, let's determine the net steps Frank takes in each direction:
1. He takes 5 steps back.
2. Then he takes 10 steps forward.
3. Next, he takes 2 steps back.
And finally, he takes double the previous backward step, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) steps forward.

Next, we calculate the total steps in each direction separately:
- Steps back: \(5 + 2 = 7\)
- Steps forward: \(10 + 4 = 14\)

The net steps forward from his original starting point is calculated as the total forward steps minus the total backward steps:

   - The regular value of a regular quarter (in a store) is $0.25.
   
2. **Gold Quarters Weight Calculation:**
   - There is 1 regular quarter (the question mentions "gold quarters" but doesn't clarify if they are the regular ones or special ones worth more).
   - Each regular quarter weighs \( \frac{1}{5} \) of an ounce.

3. **Gold Quarters Value Calculation:**
   - If a regular quarter is melted down, it is worth $100 per ounce.
   - Since a regular quarter weighs \( \frac{1}{5} \) of an ounce, the value of this quarter would be \( 100 \times \frac

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of Carlos's gold quarters if he melts them down and compares it to the value if he spends them in a store.

1. **Regular Quarters Value Calculation:**
   - The regular value of a regular quarter (in a store) is $0.25.
   
2. **Gold Quarters Weight Calculation:**
   - There is 1 regular quarter (the question mentions "gold quarters" but doesn't clarify if they are the regular ones or special ones worth more).
   - Each regular quarter weighs \( \frac{1}{5} \) of an ounce.

3. **Gold Quarters Value Calculation:**
   - If a regular quarter is melted down, it is worth $100 per ounce.
   - Since a regular quarter weighs \( \frac{1}{5} \) of an ounce, the value of this quarter would be \( 100 \times \frac

Bert bought some unique stamps for his collection. Before the purchase, he had only half the stamps he bought. If he bought 300 stamps, how many stamps does Bert have in total after the purchase? 
Answer:
450 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of stamps Bert had before the purchase as \( x \). According伍ey the problem, before buying 300 stamps, Bert had half the stamps he bought. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x = \frac{1}{2} \times 300 \]
Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[ x = 150 \]
This means that Bert had 150 stamps before the purchase.

Since Bert bought 300 stamps, the total number of stamps he has now (after buying) is:
\[ 150 + 300 = 450 \]
</reasoning>

Bert has 450 stamps in total after the purchase.

Haman’s father has an egg business supplying the local market. On a Wednesday morning, his father sends him to go and collect 10 trays of eggs for sale from their store. While loading the eggs into the car, he accidentally drops two trays. He calls his father telling him this, and is told to add 7 more trays for sale. How many eggs were sold that day? 
Answer:
540 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of trays of eggs that were ultimately collected by Haman to be sold at the market and then convert that to the number of eggs, since we know each tray contains a standard amount of eggs which is not explicitly stated here but is implicit in the context that selling one tray results in one sale.

1. Initially, Haman is instructed to collect 10 trays of eggs.
2. He drops 2 trays, making it 10 - 2 = 8 trays left.
3. Then his father tells him to add 7 more trays, so he will be adding 7 more trays to the 8 remaining trays left.
4. Therefore, Haman will have 8 + 7 = 15 trays of eggs ready to be sold.
5. The problem doesn't specify the number of eggs per tray, but the context implies that each tray is a unit of sale.

All 20 of Grant’s baby teeth have fallen out and he has a total of $54 from the tooth fairy. Every time he lost a tooth, he put it under his pillow for the tooth fairy, except for one that he dropped on the way home from school and another he swallowed accidentally. The tooth fairy left Grant $20 when he lost his first tooth. How much did the tooth fairy leave him per tooth after his first tooth, assuming equal money exchanged for each tooth thereafter? 
Answer:
2 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many teeth Grant received money from after the first one (since $20 was doubled for the first tooth). The total money he received from the tooth fairy is $54. This includes the $20 for his first tooth, so we subtract that to find the money for the remaining teeth.

1. Calculate the total money earned from the remaining teeth:
   \[
   54 - 20 = 34
   \]

2. Grant had 20 teeth in total, but the first one and two others were not saved under his pillow, meaning he had 17 teeth that were saved. The remaining money was distributed equally among 17 teeth, so we calculate the amount per tooth after the first one as follows:
   \[
   \frac{34}{17} = 2

Tate finishes high school in 1 year less than normal.  It takes him 3 times that long to get his bachelor's degree and Ph.D.  How many years did he spend in high school and college? 
Answer:
12 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's denote the normal duration for high school as \( x \) years. Thus, Tate spent \( x - 1 \) years in high school. The problem states that it takes him three times the duration of high school to earn his bachelor's degree and Ph.D., which can be written as \( 3(x - 1) \) years.

The total time spent in school, including high school and college, is the sum of the time spent in high school and the time spent in college. We need to find this total in years.

Total time spent in school = High school + College
\[ \text{Total time spent} = (x - 1) + 3(x - 1) \]
\[ \text{Total time spent} = (x - 1) + 3x - 3 \]

- Therefore, the total value from the $100 bills is \( 2 \times $100 = $200 \).

Next, we consider the $50 bills:
- Meghan had 5 $50 bills.
- Therefore, the total value from the $50 bills is \( 5 \times $50 = $250 \).

Finally, we look at the $10 bills:
- Meghan had 10 $10 bills.
- Therefore, the total value from the $10 bills is \( 10 \times $10 = $100 \).

To find the average number of times that Mr. Roper cuts his lawn per month, we need to calculate the total number of times he cuts his lawn over the year and then divide that by the number of months in the year.

- From April to September (6 months), he cuts his lawn 15 times a month. So over this period, he cuts his lawn 6 * 15 times.
- From October to March (6 months), he cuts his lawn 3 times a month. So over this period, he cuts his lawn 6 * 3 times.

The total number of times he cuts his lawn over the year is:
6 * 15 (for 6 months) + 6 * 3 (for 6 months) = 90 + 18 = 108 times.

Since we're working with the entire year (12 months), we divide the total by 12 to find the average

To run his grocery store, Mr. Haj needs $4000 a day. This money is used to pay for orders done, delivery costs and employees' salaries. If he spends 2/5 of the total operation costs on employees' salary and 1/4 of the remaining amount on delivery costs, how much money does he pay for the orders done? 
Answer:
1800 
Response:
<reasoning>
Mr. Haj spends 2/5 of his total daily operation costs on salaries, 1/4 of the remaining amount on delivery costs. So, first we need to find 1/5 of his daily operation costs (since 2/5 + 1/5 = 1/5) which is on the salary. Then, we need to find out how much is left after paying for the salary and then deducing the remaining amount on delivery costs. Finally, the remaining amount after paying for salaries and delivery costs will be the amount spent on orders done.

The daily total operation costs are $4000. Let's calculate.
</reasoning>
<answer>
To find out the amount given for salaries, we take 2/5 of $4000:

Ken caught twice as many fish as Kendra, but Ken released 3 fish back into the lake. Kendra caught 30 fish and did not release any of them back into the lake. How many fish did Ken and Kendra bring home? 
Answer:
87 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how many fish Ken and Kendra brought home, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish Ken initially caught.
2. Subtract the number of fish Ken released.
3. Sum the number of fish caught by both Ken and Kendra.

Kendra caught 30 fish. Given that Ken caught twice as many fish as Kendra, we first find out how many fish Ken caught initially:
\[ \text{Fish caught by Ken initially} = 2 \times \text{Fish caught by Kendra} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Ken released 3 fish back into the lake. To find how many fish Ken actually brought home, we subtract the fish he released from the fish he initially caught:
\[ \text{Fish brought home by Ken} = \text{Fish caught initially by Ken} - \text{Fish released by Ken} = 60 - 3 = 5

Ben has $2000 for his business operations costs. He orders goods from his supplier and writes them a cheque for $600. His debtor pays him $800 from the purchases they had made on credit. Mr. Ben then decides to do equipment maintenance and spends $1200 on the whole operation. How much money is Mr. Ben remaining with? 
Answer:
1000 
Response:
<reasoning>
Ben initially had $200 boss. He wrote a cheque for $600 to his supplier. This reduces his money balance:
\[
2000 - 600 = 1400
\]
His debtor then gave him $800, which increases his money balance:
\[
1400 + 800 = 2200
\]
For the equipment maintenance, Ben spent $1200. This subtracts from his total balance:
\[
2200 - 1200 = 1000
\]
Therefore, Ben is left with $1000.

Billy has four horses. Each one eats 4 pounds of oats, twice a day. How many pounds of oats does he need to feed his horses for 3 days? 
Answer:
96 
Response:
<reasoning>
Billy has 4 horses, and each horse eats 4 pounds of oats twice a day. First, we'll calculate the total amount of oats one horse needs for one day. Since each horse eats 4 pounds twice a day, the daily oats consumption for one horse is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, Billy has 4 horses, so the total oats consumption for all the horses in one day is:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds/day per horse} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 32 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Billy needs to feed his horses for 3 days, so the total amount of oats needed is:
\[ 32 \text{ pounds/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 96 \text{ pounds} \]

There was only enough room for 21 people on a raft if no one wore life jackets. There were 7 fewer people who could fit on the raft if everyone wore life jackets. If 8 people on the raft needed life jackets, how many people could fit on the raft? 
Answer:
17 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's determine the number of people who could fit on the raft based on different scenarios. We know that with everyone wearing life jackets, 7 fewer people could fit than without life jackets on the raft. If initially 21 people could fit without life jackets, we need to determine how many could fit with 7 fewer people fitting per use of life jackets.

Given that:
- With life jackets: 7 fewer people than without.
- With 8 people needing life jackets: We need to calculate the difference.

Start by assuming 1 life jacket. 21 - 1 = 20 would fit without a life jacket or with 1 life jacket. According ml.tn this pattern, 20 - 1 = 19 would fit if 2 people needed life jackets. 19 - 1 = 18 with 3 needed life jackets, and so on. Let’s generalize this pattern:

Nigella is a realtor who earns a base salary of $3,000 a month plus a 2% commission on every house she sells. One month, Nigella sells 3 houses and earns $8,000 total. House B costs three times as much as House A. House C cost twice as much as House A minus $110,000. How much did House A cost? 
Answer:
60000 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve for the price of House A, first let's calculate how much Nigella earned from commissions on the houses she sold. Her total earnings are $8,000, and this includes both her base salary of $3,000 and her commission from sales.

Total earnings from commission = Total earnings - Base salary
Total earnings from commission = $8,000 - $3,000 = $5,000

Since Nigella earns a 2% commission on each house sold, let's find the total sales for the three houses sold by setting up an equation:

Total sales = Base salary + Commission
Total sales = $3,000 + 0.02 * (Price of House A + Price of House B + Price of House C) = $8,000

Given that House B costs three times as much as House A, we can represent House B's price as

Ayen jogs for 30 minutes every day during weekdays. This week on Tuesday, she jogged 5 minutes more and also jogged 25 minutes more on Friday. How many hours, in total, did Ayen jog this week? 
Answer:
3 
Response:

To find out how many hours Ayen jogged this week, we first need to calculate the total jogging time in minutes for the weekdays (Monday, Wednesday, Friday included). Normally, she jogged 30 minutes each day from Monday to Friday. However, there were adjustments on Tuesday and Friday.

- Normally, she would jog for 30 minutes a day, so over 5 days it would be 5 * 30 = 150 minutes.
- On Tuesday, she jogged for 30 + 5 = 35 minutes.
- On Friday, she jogged for 30 + 25 = 55 minutes.

Thus, we add the adjusted times for Tuesday and Friday to the usual 4 days:

- Total jogging time: (4 * 30) + 35 + 55 = 120 + 35 + 55 = 210 minutes.

A farmer is selling ducks and chickens at the market. He sells ducks for $10 and chickens for $8. He sells 5 chickens and some ducks. He then spends half his earnings on a new wheelbarrow. After buying it, someone sees it and agrees to pay the farmer double what the farmer paid and the farmer earns another $60. How many ducks did the farmer sell? 
Answer:
2 
Response:

Let's denote the number of ducks sold by the farmer as \(d\) and the total amount earned using the earnings from selling chickens as \(c\). The total earnings from selling 5 chickens at $8 each is:
\[ c = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Then, the total earnings including the earnings from the ducks are:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = c + 10d = 40 + 10d \]

The farmer then spends half of his earnings on a new wheelbarrow, so he spends:
\[ \text{Cost of wheelbarrow} = \frac{40 + 10d}{2} \]

He earns another $60 after selling the wheelbarrow to someone for double the amount he initially spent:

-------------------- Question:
In Professor Plum's biology class there are 40 students. Of those students, 80 percent have puppies. Of those who have puppies, 25% also have parrots. How many students have both puppies and parrots? 
Answer:
8 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how many students have both puppies and parrots, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students who have puppies.
2. Determine what 25% of those students (those who have puppies) represents.

First, calculate the number of students who have puppies:
- Total students with puppies = 80% of 40
- Total students with puppies = 0.80 * 40 = 32 students

Next, we need to find out how many of these 32 students also have parrots:
- Students with both puppies and parrots = 25% of students with puppies
- Students with both puppies and parrots = 0.25 * 32

Now, perform the multiplication:
- Students with both puppies and parrots = 0.25 * 32 = 8

Thus, 8 students have both puppies and parrots.

-------------------- Question:
Sara is 6 inches taller than her brother Joe. Joe is 3 inches taller than his friend Roy. If Roy is 36 inches tall, how tall is Sara? 
Answer:
45 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine Sara's height, we need to establish the heights of Joe and Sara based on the information given. We know that Roy's height is 36 inches. Joe is 3 inches taller than Roy, so we can find Joe's height by adding 3 inches to Roy's height. Then, we know that Sara is 6 inches taller than Joe, so we can add 6 inches to Joe's height to find Sara's height.

First, let's calculate Joe's height:
\[
\text{Joe's height} = \text{Roy's height} + 3 \, \text{inches} = 36 \, \text{inches} + 3 \, \text{inches} = 39 \, \text{inches}
\]

Next, we calculate Sara's height:
\[
\text{Sara's height} = \text{Joe's height} + 6 \,

-------------------- Question:
Rollo has 3 guinea pigs, the first guinea pig eats 2 cups of food, the second guinea pig eats twice as much as the first one, and the third guinea pig eats 3 cups more than the second one. How many cups of food does Rollo need to feed all his Guinea pigs? 
Answer:
13 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine the total amount of food needed for Rollo's 3 guinea pigs, we first need to calculate how much each guinea pig eats based on the information given:

1. The first guinea pig eats 2 cups of food.
2. The second guinea pig eats twice as much as the first one, which means the second guinea pig eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) cups of food.
3. The third guinea pig eats 3 cups more than the second one, which means it eats \(4 + 3 = 7\) cups of food.

Next, we sum the food consumption of all three guinea pigs to find the total amount of food needed:
\[
2 \, (\text{cups by first guinea pig}) + 4 \, (\text{cups by the second guinea pig}) + 7 \, (\text{cups by the third guinea pig}) =

-------------------- Question:
Louise is in a toy store. She already has 28 toys worth $10 each in her cart. On her way to the till she adds 20 teddy bears to the cart. If the $580 in Louise’s wallet is exactly enough to pay for all the toys, how much does each teddy bear cost? 
Answer:
15 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let us denote the cost of each teddy bear as \( t \). Louise initially has 28 toys worth $10 each, so the cost of these toys is \( 28 \times 10 = $280 \). She adds 20 teddy bears to her cart. Thus, the total cost of all her toys is \( 280 + 20t \).

According to the problem, the total cost equals $580, as Louise has exactly $580 in her wallet. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 280 + 20t = 580 \]

To find the cost of each teddy bear, we need to solve this equation for \( t \). Subtract 280 from both sides to isolate the terms with \( t \):
\[ 20t = 300 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2

Chad has 100 apples and each apple has different sizes and different price ranges. Each small apple cost $1.5, medium apple cost $2, and big apples cost $3. If Donny bought 6 small and medium apples and also 8 big apples, how much will Donny have to pay for all of it? 
Answer:
45 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how much Donny will have to pay for the apples, we need to calculate the cost of the apples he bought:

1. He bought 6 small and medium apples. Since each small apple costs $1.5 and each medium apple costs $2, we can calculate the total cost of the small and medium apples as follows:
   - Let's assume he bought \( x \) small apples and \( y \) medium apples. Then, \( x + y = 6 \).
   - The total cost for small and medium apples is \( 1.5x + 2y \).

2. Donny also bought 8 big apples at $3 each, so the cost for the big apples is \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \) dollars.

3. The total cost will be the sum of the cost of the small and medium apples and the cost of the big apples, e.g., \( 1.

-------------------- Question:
In April, Tank gathered 10 more Easter eggs than Emma in their first round of egg hunt. However, Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank in their second round of egg hunt, while Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the number she had gathered in the first round. If the total number of eggs in the pile they were collecting with 6 other people was 400 eggs, and Emma gathered 60 eggs in the second egg hunt round, find the number of eggs that the 6 other egg hunters collected? 
Answer:
220 
Response:
<reasoning>
From the information given, we can derive the following:

1. In the first round, let’s denote the number of eggs Tank gathered as \(T_1\), and the number of eggs Emma gathered as \(E_1\). Therefore, \(T_1 = E_1 + 10\).
2. In the second round, Emma gathered 60 eggs, which is twice as many as Tank gathered, thus \(E_2 = 60\) and \(T_2 = 30\). We are also told that \(T_2 = T_1 - 20\).
3. Since \(T_1 = T_2 + 20\), and given that \(T_2 = 30\), we can determine \(T_1 = 130\). Then, using \(T_1 = E_1 + 10\), we find \(E_1 =
