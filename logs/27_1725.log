-------------------- Question:
A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all? 
Answer:
476 
Response:
<reasoning>
Mr. Benson bought 12 concert tickets in total. The first 10 tickets are not discounted, and the remaining 2 tickets are discounted. The cost of each ticket is $40. A 5% discount on the second 2 tickets means each of those tickets is sold at 95% of their original price.

For the first 10 tickets:
- Each ticket costs $40.
- Therefore, the cost for 10 tickets is \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.
- The 5% discount affects only the extra 2 tickets beyond the initial 10.

For the next 2 tickets with a 5% discount:
- Each of these tickets is discounted at \(40 \times (1 - 0.05) = 40 \times 0.95 = 38\) dollars.
- The total cost for the additional 2 discounted tickets is \(2 \times 38 = 76\) dollars.

Now, to find the total amount Mr. Benson paid, we add the cost of the first 10 tickets and the cost of the extra 2 discounted tickets together:
\[ 400 + 76 = 476 \]

</reasoning>

Over the past five years, on July 4th, the high temperature for Washington, DC has been: 90 degrees in 2020, 90 degrees in 2019, 90 degrees in 2018, 79 degrees in 2017 and 71 degrees in 2016. What is the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past 5 years? 
Answer:
84 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past 5 years, we need to add up all the temperatures for the specified years and then divide by the number of years (which is 5).

The temperatures are:
- 2020: 90 degrees
- 2019: 90 degrees
- 2018: 90 degrees
- 2017: 79 degrees
- 2016: 71 degrees

First, sum up all the temperatures:
\[
90 + 90 + 90 + 79 + 71 = 410
\]

Next, divide the total sum by the number of years to get the average:
\[
\frac{410}{5} = 82
\]

Hence, the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past 5 years is 82 degrees.

Matt can make a batch of a dozen cookies using 2 pounds of flour.  He uses 4 bags of flour each weighing 5 pounds.  If Jim eats 15 cookies how many cookies are left? 
Answer:
105 
Response:
<reasoning>
First, we need to determine how many cookies Matt originally bakes with the flour he has. We know that Matt can make a dozen (12) cookies with 2 pounds of flour. 

Matt has 4 bags of flour, each weighing 5 pounds. So, the total weight of the flour he has is:
\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ pounds/bag} = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

Given that 2 pounds of flour make 12 cookies, we can calculate how many dozen cookies he can make with 20 pounds of flour:
\[ \frac{20\text{ pounds}}{2\text{ pounds/dozen}} = 10 \text{ dozen cookies} \]

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 cookies, 10 dozen cookies would be:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ cookies} \]

Once Jim eats 15 cookies, the remaining number of cookies can be calculated by subtracting the 15 cookies eaten from the total number of cookies made:
\[ 120 - 15 = 105 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, the number of cookies left is 105.

Janelle had 26 green marbles. Then she bought 6 bags of blue marbles. There were 10 marbles in each bag.  She created a gift of 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles and gave it to a friend. How many marbles does Janelle have now? 
Answer:
72 
Response:
<reasoning>
Janelle initially had 26 green marbles. She also bought 6 bags of blue marbles with 10 marbles in each bag, which amounts to 6*1L0 = 60 blue marbles. After assembling a gift of 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles, she gave it to her friend, reducing her total inventory. To find out how many marbles she has left, we need to subtract the number of marbles given away from her initial total.

First, Janelle had 26 + 60 = 86 marbles before giving away the gift. 

Then she gave away 6 + 8 = 14 marbles in the gift.

Subtracting the given away marbles from the initial total, we have 86 - 14 = 72 marbles left.

-------------------- Question:
Zach baked cookies for a bake sale. On Monday he baked 32 cookies. On Tuesday he ran out of sugar and could only bake half of the number of cookies he baked the day before. On Wednesday he baked three times the number of cookies he did on Tuesday, but his brother ate 4 of those cookies. How many cookies did he have at the end of the three days? 
Answer:
92 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine the total number of cookies Zach had at the end of the three days, we need to calculate the number of cookies baked each day and then subtract the cookies eaten by his brother.

1. Calculate the number of cookies baked on Monday:
   - Given that Zach baked 32 cookies on Monday.
   - Let the number of cookies baked on Monday be \( C_{\text{Monday}} = 32 \).

2. Calculate the number of cookies baked on Tuesday:
   - Zach baked half the number of cookies he baked on Monday.
   - Hence, the number of cookies baked on Tuesday \( C_{\text{Tuesday}} = \frac{1}{2} \times C_{\text{Monday}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16 \).

3. Calculate the number of cookies baked on Wednesday before his brother ate any:
   - Zach baked three times the number of cookies he did on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of cookies baked on Wednesday \( C_{\text{Wednesday}} = 3 \times C_{\text{Tuesday}} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \).

4. Subtract the cookies eaten by his brother:
   - His brother ate 4 cookies from the cookies baked on Wednesday.
   - Therefore, the number of cookies left after his brother ate some \( C_{\text{end}} = C_{\text{Wednesday}} - 4 = 48 - 4 = 44 \).

5. Sum up the cookies baked throughout the days before the brother ate any:
   - Total cookies baked over the three days before his brother ate some is the sum of the cookies he baked on Monday and Tuesday, plus the cookies he baked on Wednesday before his brother ate any.
   - Total cookies baked before his brother ate: \( C_{\text{Monday}} + C_{\text{Tuesday}} + C_{\text{Wednesday}} = 32 + 16 + 48 = 96 \).

6. The final number of cookies Zach had at the end of the three days is when the brother ate his cookies:
   - Final number of cookies: \( C_{\text{end}} = 44 \).

A four-layer pyramid is being built with each layer having three times as many sandstone blocks as the layer above it. The top layer is a single block. How many sandstone blocks are in the pyramid? 
Answer:
40 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine the total number of sandstone blocks in the four-layer pyramid, we start by noting that the top layer, which is the apex, has 1 block. Each subsequent layer has three times as many blocks as the one above it.

Let's denote the number of blocks in the top layer (which is the apex) as \( 1 \).

The second layer, being the second from the top, will have \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \) blocks.

The third layer, which is the third from the top, will have \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) blocks.

The fourth and bottommost layer, which is the pyramid's base, will have \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \) blocks.

To find the total number of sandstone blocks in the pyramid, we sum the number of blocks in each layer:
\[
1 + 3 + 9 + 27 
\]

Adding these up:
\[
1 + 3 = 4
\]
\[
4 + 9 = 13
\]
\[
13 + 27 = 40
\]

Therefore, the total number of sandstone blocks in the pyramid is 40.

Andy walks 50 meters from his house to school. After school, he comes back to the house and goes to the market. If he walks 140 meters in total, how many meters is the distance between the house and the market? 
Answer:
40 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance Andy walked from his house to the market based on the information given.

1. Andy walks 50 meters from his house to school.
2. He returns from the school to the house, covering another 50 meters.
3. He then goes to the market.
4. The total distance he walked is 140 meters.

The distance between the house and the market can be determined by subtracting the distance he traveled from his house to school and back, from the total distance he walked. 

So, the distance to the market is:
\[ \text{Distance to market} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance from house to school and back} \]
\[ \text{Distance to market} = 140 \text{ meters} - 100 \text{ meters} \]
\[ \text{Distance to market} = 40 \text{ meters} \]

Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first? 
Answer:
17 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's work backwards and forward step-by-phase to solve this problem.

First, Michael gives his brother half of his money, so the brother gets $42 / 2 = $21. Then, his brother spends $3 on candy, and he has $35 left after that. Therefore, before buying candy, the brother had $35 + $3 = $38. We then need to know how much money his brother had initially.

Michael gave the brother $21, and this $21 is what his brother had after spending $3 on candy. So, initially, before giving away half of his money and then buying candy, his brother had $21 + $3 (which he spent on candy) = $24.

Now, we are told that before Michael gave him half of his money, he had nothing, and then his brother received $24.

Therefore, the brother initially had $0, and he got $24 more from Michael, so he received a total of $24. Therefore, the answer is that his brother initially had $0 dollars.

Barry, Thomas and Emmanuel are to share a jar of 200 jelly beans. If Thomas takes 10%, and Barry and Emmanuel are to share the remainder in the ratio 4:5 respectively, how many jelly beans will Emmanuel get? 
Answer:
100 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Calculate how many jelly beans Thomas takes.
   - Thomas takes 10% of the 200 jelly beans.
   - Therefore, Thomas takes \(200 \times 0.10 = 20\) jelly beans.

2. Determine how many jelly beans are left after Thomas takes his share.
   - Total jelly beans initially = 200
   - Thomas's share = 20
   - Remaining jelly beans = 200 - 20 = 180

3. Calculate how many jelly beans Barry and Emmanuel will share.
   - Barry and Emmanuel share the remaining jelly beans in the ratio 4:5.

4. Determine the number of jelly beans Emmanuel will get.
   - The total ratio is 4 + 5 = 9 parts.
   - Barry's share is \(8.89\overline{8}\) of the remaining 180 jelly beans.
   - Emmanuel's share is \(3.5\) of the remaining 180 jelly beans.
   - Therefore, Emmanuel's share = \(180 \times \frac{5}{9} = 100\).

-------------------- Question:
Andy is a lawyer who's working on two lawsuits. The first lawsuit has a 30% chance of paying out $5,000,000 upon a win and $0 if he loses it. The second lawsuit has a 50% chance of paying out $1,000,000 if Andy loses and a 50% chance of paying out $2,000,000 if he wins.  Expressed as a percentage, how much more likely is it that Andy loses both lawsuits compared to winning both of them? 
Answer:
20 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how likely it is that Andy loses both lawsuits compared to winning both of them, we can calculate the probabilities of these two outcomes separately and then compare them.

For the first lawsuit:
- Win: 30%, or 0.3
- Lose: 70%, or 0.7

For the second lawsuit:
- Win: 50%, or 0.5
- Lose: 50%, or 0.5

Winning both lawsuits' probability:
\[ P(\text{Win both}) = P(\text{Win 1st}) \times P(\text{Win 2nd}) = 0.3 \times 0.5 = 0.15 \]
So, the probability of winning both lawsuits is 15%.

Losing both lawsuits' probability:
\[ P(\text{Lose both}) = P(\text{Lose 1st}) \times P(\text{Lose 2nd}) = 0.7 \times 0.5 = 0.35 \]
So, the probability of losing both lawsuits is 35%.

Now we need to compare these probabilities.
- The probability of losing both lawsuits is 35%.
- The probability of winning both lawsuits is 15%.

The difference between these probabilities is:
\[ 35\% - 15\% = 20\% \]

Thus, Andy is 20% more likely to lose both lawsuits compared to winning both of them.

John is half times younger than his father, who is 4 years older than John's mother. If John's father is 40 years old, what's the age difference between John and his mother? 
Answer:
16 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's start by representing John’s age as \( J \). According chord the problem, John is half as old as his father, so we can write:

\[ J = \frac{1}{2}F \]

We are informed that John's father is 40 years old, so:

\[ F = 40 \]
\[ J = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \]

John's mother is 4 years younger than John's father. Therefore, we can find the mother's age by subtracting 4 from John's father's age:

\[ M = F - 4 \]
\[ M = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

The age difference between John and his mother is the absolute value of the difference between their ages:

\[ Age\,Difference = |M - J| \]
\[ Age\,Difference = |36 - 20| \]
\[ Age\,Difference = 16 \]

Lisa has decided to replace her old cutlery. As she is going through the cupboards, she sees the spoons from when each of her 4 children were babies as well as 2 decorative spoons she created. She doesn't want to get rid of any of these so she adds them to her new set of cutlery. The new set of cutlery has 10 large spoons and 15 teaspoons. If the children each had 3 spoons when they were babies, how many spoons does Lisa now have? 
Answer:
39 
Response:
<reasoning>
Lisa's new set of cutlery includes 10 large spoons and 15 teaspoons, meaning she has 25 spoons that are part of the new set (10 + 15). Additionally, Lisa has 4 spare spoons from her children's babyhoods and 2 decorative spoons that she wants to keep. The children gave Lisa a total of 4 x 3 = 12 baby spoons. We need to add these together: 25 (from the new set) + 12 (baby spoons) + 4 (spare spoons) + 2 (decorative spoons) = total spoons.

-------------------- Question:
Marites internet speed is 10 megabits per second and her monthly internet bill is $20. Marites is planning to upgrade her service and choosing between 20 Mbps and 30 Mbps. If the price of the 30 Mbps is twice the amount of her current monthly bill and the price of the 20 Mbps is $10 more than her current monthly bill, how much will she save per year if she chooses the 20 Mbps than 30 Mbps? 
Answer:
120 
Response:
<reasoning>
We need to calculate Marites' yearly savings if she chooses a 20 Mbps plan over a 30 Mbps plan. First, we will find out the monthly cost for both plans: a 20 Mbps plan and a 30 Mbps plan. We know that Marites' current monthly bill is $20. If she chooses the 30 Mbps plan, it costs twice as much as her current bill. If she chooses the 20 Mbps plan, it costs $10 more than her current monthly bill. 

Next, we calculate the annual cost for both the 20 Mbps and 30 Mbps plans. 

For the 30 Mbps plan, it costs twice her current monthly bill:
\[
30 \, \text{Mbps plan cost} = 2 \times 20 \, \text{USD} = 40 \, \text{USD}
\]

For the 20 Mbps plan, it costs $10 more than her current bill:
\[
20 \, \text{bps plan cost} = 20 \, \text{USD} + 10 \, \text{USD} = 30 \, \text{USD}
\]

Now, to find her yearly savings, we subtract the 20 Mbps plan annual cost from the 30 Mbps plan annual cost, and then multiply by 12 to get the yearly savings:
\[
\text{Yearly Savings} = (30 \, \text{USD} - 40 \, \text{USD}) \times 12
\]

Since the 30 Mbps plan is actually more expensive than the current plan or the 20 Mbps plan, we need to re-evaluate the plan costs. According to the problem, the prices are stated as given. We should pay attention to the incremental savings when choosing between the 30 Mbps and 20 Mbps plans. 
</reasoning>

<answer>
Marites will actually incur a higher cost with the 20 Mbps plan than the 30 Mbps plan. The correct calculation confirms that the savings per year if she chooses the 20 Mbps plan over the 30 Mbps plan would result in a negative value, which is not practical. 
Therefore, Marites will not save money by going with the 20 Mbps plan compared to the 30 Mbps plan. If we were to calculate negative savings, it

Suzie and 5 of her friends decide to rent an Airbnb at Lake Tahoe for 4 days from Thursday to Sunday. The rental rate for weekdays is $420 per day. The weekend rental rate is $540 per day. They all decide to split the rental evenly. How much does each person have to pay? 
Answer:
320 
Response:
<reasoning>
Suzie and her 5 friends make 6 people in total. They are renting the Airbnb for 4 days from Thursday to Sunday. The rental costs break down as follows:

- For Thursday and Friday (weekdays), the rate is $420 per day for 2 days, which totals $840 for these 2 days.
- For Saturday and Sunday (weekend), the rate is $540 per day for 2 days, which totals $1080 for these 2 days.

So, the total rental cost is $840 + $1080 = $1920. Since the 6 friends are splitting the cost evenly, each person will need to pay $1920 / 6 = $320.

Horatio is a poet composing sonnets for his lady fair. He believes it will take many of his sonnets to win her over. Each sonnet is fourteen lines long. His lady fair tells him to leave her alone after he reads her only seven sonnets, and Horatio is heartbroken over the 70 romantic lines he wrote that she never heard. How many sonnets did Horatio write in all? 
Answer:
12 
Response:
<reasoning>
Horatio wrote seven sonnets for his lady fair. Each sonnet is fourteen lines long. Therefore, the total number of lines he wrote is calculated by multiplying the number of sonnets by the number of lines per sonnet.

Total lines written = Number of sonnets × Lines per sonnet
Total lines written = 7 × 14

Horatio's lady fair never heard the rest of his sonnets, which means she didn't hear the 35 lines of the remaining 3 sonnets. Therefore, the total number of sonnets Horatio wrote is the number of sonnets he read to his lady plus the 3 remaining sonnets she didn't hear.

Total sonnets written = Sonnets read + Remaining sonnets not heard
Total sonnets written = 7 + 3

We can calculate the total number of sonnets written by Horatio.

A party hall has 3 decorative light bulbs; a red light bulb which comes on every 2 seconds, a green one every 3 seconds and a blue one every 4 seconds. If they are put on at the same time, what is the shortest time after which the three bulbs will be on at the same time? 
Answer:
12 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the shortest time after which all three light bulbs will be on at the same time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals at which the bulbs come on. The intervals given are 2 seconds for the red bulb, 3 seconds for the green bulb, and 4 seconds for the blue bulb.

First, we list the prime factors of each interval:
- The prime factors of 2 are {2}.
- The prime factors of 3 are {3}.
- The prime factors of 4 are {2, 2}.

Next, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in these factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^2 (from 4).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^1 (from 3).

The LCM is then calculated by multiplying these highest powers together:
- LCM = 2^2 * 3^1 = 4 * 3 = 12.

Thus, the shortest time after which the three bulbs will be on at the same time is 12 seconds.

Frank is practicing a new dance move.  It starts with him take 5 steps back, and then 10 steps forward, and then 2 steps back, and then double that amount forward.  How many steps forward is Frank from his original starting point? 
Answer:
7 
Response:
<reasoning>
Frank follows a sequence of movements: 5 steps back, then 10 steps forward, then 2 steps back, and then double that amount (2 steps) forward. To find out how many steps forward he is from his original starting point, we need to calculate the total steps backward and forward separately and then find the net result.

First, let's add up the steps in the sequence:
- Steps backward: 5 + 2 = 7 steps backward
- Steps forward: 10 + (2 * 2) = 10 + 4 = 14 steps forward

Now, net steps are calculated as:
- Total steps forward: 14 steps
- Total steps backward: 7 steps

To find the net steps forward from his original starting point, we subtract the steps backward from the steps forward:
- Net steps forward: 14 - 7 = 7 steps

So, Frank is 7 steps forward from his original starting point.

Carlos has some gold quarters. If he spends them in a store, they are worth the regular amount. If he melts them down, he can get $100 per ounce. Each quarter weighs 1/5 of an ounce. How many times more money would he get from melting them down instead of spending them in a store? 
Answer:
80 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve this, we first need to calculate how much Carlos would get if he spends his quarters in a store versus if he melts them down. Given that each quarter is worth $10 by itself and he has the same number of quarters, the monetary value of his collection doesn't change whether he spends or melts them. However, the question is asking for the difference in value per quarter if melted versus if spent.

- If he spends the quarters in a store, each quarter is worth $10.
- If he melts them down, they are worth $100 per ounce. Since each quarter is worth 1/5 of an ounce, when melted down, each quarter is worth $100 * (1/5 ounce) = $20 per quarter.

To find out how many times more money he would get from melting them down, we compute the ratio of the melted value to the spent value. This would be $20 (value from melting) / $10 (value from spending) = 2.

Haman’s father has an egg business supplying the local market. On a Wednesday morning, his father sends him to go and collect 10 trays of eggs for sale from their store. While loading the eggs into the car, he accidentally drops two trays. He calls his father telling him this, and is told to add 7 more trays for sale. How many eggs were sold that day? 
Answer:
540 
Response:
<reasoning>
Haman initially was sent to collect 10 trays of eggs. However, he accidentally dropped 2 trays and therefore was told to add 7 more trays to make up for the loss. So, after the accident, he had 10 - 2 + 7 = 15 trays. The total number of trays he sold later became 15 trays. Since the problem doesn’t specify the number of eggs in each tray, it’s reasonable to assume each tray contains the same number of eggs. However, the number of eggs sold remains dependent on the number of trays and the fact that all trays were used plus the additional ones given. 

To find the total number of eggs sold, assuming each tray contains a consistent number of eggs, we can multiply the number of trays by the number of eggs per tray. Given the problem doesn't specify the number of eggs per tray, we can proceed as if all trays were used plus additional ones. 

Therefore, the number of eggs sold is 15 trays.

All 20 of Grant’s baby teeth have fallen out and he has a total of $54 from the tooth fairy. Every time he lost a tooth, he put it under his pillow for the tooth fairy, except for one that he dropped on the way home from school and another he swallowed accidentally. The tooth fairy left Grant $20 when he lost his first tooth. How much did the tooth fairy leave him per tooth after his first tooth, assuming equal money exchanged for each tooth thereafter? 
Answer:
2 
Response:
<reasoning>
Grant received $20 for his first tooth and has $54 in total from the tooth fairy. Therefore, the amount received for his subsequent 18 teeth is $54 - $2格 0 = $34. We need to determine the amount the tooth fairy left per tooth after the first one, assuming all subsequent teeth received the same amount. To find the average money per tooth, we divide the total amount received for the 18 teeth by 18.
</reasoning>

<answer>
The tooth fairy left Grant $34 / 18 = $1.888... per tooth after his first tooth.
Simplified to the nearest cent, the tooth fairy left Grant $1.89 per tooth after his first tooth.

Mrs. Wilsborough saved $500 to buy concert tickets for her family. She bought 2 VIP tickets at $100 each and 3 regular tickets at $50 each. How much of her savings does Mrs. Wilsborough have after she buys the tickets? 
Answer:
150 
Response:
<reasoning>
Mrs. Wilsborough's total expenditure on the concert tickets includes the cost of the VIP tickets and the regular tickets. The cost for the VIP tickets is $100 x 2 = $200. The cost for the 3 regular tickets is $50 x 3 = $150. To find out the total saved after purchasing the tickets, we subtract the total cost of the tickets from her initial savings of $500. This can be represented as $500 - ($200 + $150) = $500 - $350. Therefore, the calculation of her remaining savings is straightforward.

Gwendolyn can read 200 sentences of a book in 1 hour. She just brought a book from the library, having 20 paragraphs per page. What's the total time Gwendolyn will take to read the book if each paragraph has 10 sentences and the book has 50 pages? 
Answer:
50 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out the total time Gwendolyn will take to read the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of paragraphs in the book.
2. Given that each paragraph has 10 sentences, we calculate the total number of sentences in the book.
3. Knowing Gwendolyn's reading rate (200 sentences per hour), use this to determine the total time required to read all the sentences.

Let's start with step 1: 
The book has 50 pages, and each page has 20 paragraphs. 
Thus, the total number of paragraphs in the book = 50 pages * 20 paragraphs/page = 1000 paragraphs.

Step 2:
Since each paragraph contains 10 sentences,
The total number of sentences in the book = 1000 paragraphs * 10 sentences/paragraph = 10,000 sentences.

Step 3:
Gwendolyn can read 200 sentences in an hour.
To read 10,000 sentences, the time required = total number of sentences / sentences per hour = 10,000 sentences / 200 sentences/hour = 50 hours.

</reasoning>
<answer>
Therefore, Gwendolyn will take 50 hours to read the entire book.

Tate finishes high school in 1 year less than normal.  It takes him 3 times that long to get his bachelor's degree and Ph.D.  How many years did he spend in high school and college? 
Answer:
12 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's define the variables:
- Let \(x\) be the number of years Tate normally spends in high school.
- Then, Tate finishes high school in \(x - 1\) years.

For his bachelor's degree and PhD, it takes him 3 times the time he took to finish high school, which is \(3(x - 1)\) years.

To find the total time spent in high school and college, we simply add the time spent on high school and the time spent on his bachelor's degree and PhD together.

Thus, the total time spent is:
\[x + 3(x - 1)\]

Expanding the equation:
\[x + 3x - 3 = 4x - 3\]

To answer the question, we need to know the value of \(x\). Let's assume that the normal duration of high school is 4 years (a common duration in many U.S. states). So, \(x = 4\).

Substituting \(x = 4\) into the equation:
\[4x - 3 = 4(4) - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13\]
So, Tate spent 13 years in high school and college.

-------------------- Question:
Jon's laundry machine can do 5 pounds of laundry at a time.  4 shirts weigh 1 pound and 2 pairs of pants weigh 1 pound.  If he needs to wash 20 shirts and 20 pants, how many loads of laundry does he have to do? 
Answer:
3 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine the number of laundry loads Jon has to do, we first need to calculate the total weight of the shirts and pants separately, and then divide by the machine's capacity.

Given:
- Each shirt weighs 0.2 pounds (1 pound/4 shirts).
- Each pair of pants weighs 0.5 pounds (1 pound/2 pants).

Number of shirts = 20
Number of pants = 20

Total weight of shirts = 20 shirts * 0.2 pounds/shirt
Total weight of pants = 20 pants * 0.5 pounds/pants

Total laundry weight = total weight of shirts + total weight of pants

We then divide the total laundry weight by the machine's capacity (5 pounds) to find out the number of loads needed. Since the laundry machine can handle a fraction of a pound, we'll round up to ensure all clothes are washed.

We need to add 1 load if the total weight is not a whole number that is a multiple of 5.
</reasoning>
<answer>
First, calculate the total weight:
Total weight of shirts = 20 * 0.2 = 4 pounds
Total weight of pants = 20 * 0.5 = 10 pounds

Total laundry weight = 4 + 10 = 14 pounds

Now we divide by the machine's capacity:
14 pounds / 5 pounds per load = 2.8

As the laundry machine can't handle a fraction of a load, we need to round up:
2.8 rounds up to 3

Jon has to do 3 loads of laundry.

Lena played video games for 3.5 hours last weekend. Her brother played 17 minutes more than she did. How many minutes together did Lena and her brother play video games last weekend? 
Answer:
437 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, we need to first convert Lena's playtime into minutes, sum it with her brother's playtime, and then find the total playtime together.

Lena played for 3.5 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert Lena's playtime into minutes:
\[ 3.漂亮的60 = 3 \times 60 + 45 = 210 \text{ minutes} \]

Lena's brother played 17 minutes more than Lena. So, his playtime in minutes is:
\[ 210 \text{ minutes} + 17 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, to find the total playtime for both, we add Lena's playtime and her brother's playtime:

Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how much money Meghan had altogether, we need to calculate the total value of each type of bill she had and then add them together. The total value can be calculated by multiplying the quantity of each type of bill by its denomination value and then summing these values.

1. Calculate the total value of the $100 bills: 
   \[
   2 \, \text{bills} \times \$100 \, \text{per bill} = \$200
   \]

2. Calculate the total value of the $50 bills:
   \[
   5 \, \text{bills} \times \$50 \, \text{per bill} = \$250
   \]

3. Calculate the total value of the $10 bills:
   \[
   10 \, \text{bills} \times \$10 \, \text{per bill} = \$100
   \]

4. Finally, sum the total values:
   \[
   \$200 + \$250 + \$100 = \$550

Answer:
4 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how many times greater the area his friend can ride in is compared to Tommy, we first need to figure out the areas each one can ride in.

Tommy's travel route can be visualized as a path that forms a rectangle. His mother lets him ride north 2 blocks, then 3 blocks east, 2 blocks west, and then 2 blocks south. This means that his path essentially forms a rectangle that is 3 blocks in length (3 blocks east - 2 blocks west) and 2 blocks in width (2 blocks north - 2 blocks south). The area that Tommy can ride is:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{Tommy}} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ square blocks} \]

The area his friend can ride in is given as 80 square blocks. To find how many times greater the area his friend can ride in is compared to Tommy, we divide the area his friend can ride in by the area Tommy can ride in:
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{Friend}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{Tommy}}} = \frac{80}{6} = \frac{40}{3} \]

Thus, the area his friend can ride in is \(\frac{40}{3}\) times greater than the area Tommy can ride in.

Mr. Roper cuts his lawn 15 days a month beginning in April and ending in September.  From October to the end of March he cuts his lawn three times a month.  What is the average number of times that Mr. Roper cuts his yard per month? 
Answer:
9 
Response:
<reasoning>
Mr. Roper cuts his lawn for 6 months in a year, from April to September. He cuts his lawn 15 times a month during these 6 months. The remaining 6 months (from October to the end of March) he cuts the lawn 3 times a month. We need to find the average number of times he cuts his lawn per month.

First, calculate the total number of times he cuts his lawn over the entire year:
- For the first 6 months (April to September), the number of times he cuts the lawn is \(15 \text{ (times/month)} \times 6 \text{ months} = 90 \text{ times}\).
- For the last 6 months (October to March), the number of times he cuts the lawn is \(3 \text{ (times/month)} \times 6 \text{ months} = 18 \text{ times}\).

Total times he cuts the lawn over the year is \(90 + 18 = 108 \text{ times}\).

The total number of months in a year is 12 months. To find the average number of times he cuts his lawn per month, we divide the total number of cuts by the total number of months:
\[ \frac{108 \text{ times}}{12 \text{ months}} = 9 \text{ times/month} \]

To run his grocery store, Mr. Haj needs $4000 a day. This money is used to pay for orders done, delivery costs and employees' salaries. If he spends 2/5 of the total operation costs on employees' salary and 1/4 of the remaining amount on delivery costs, how much money does he pay for the orders done? 
Answer:
1800 
Response:
<reasoning>
Mr. Haj's daily expenses start with a total of $4000. According to the problem, 2/5 of this total is spent on employees' salaries. This leaves 3/5 of $4000 for delivery costs plus order payment. We then need to find out how much is spent on delivery costs, which is 1/4 of the remaining amount. Let's calculate the amount spent on employees' salaries first, then find out how much is left, and subsequently, how much is spent on delivery costs, finally arriving at the amount used for orders done.
</reasoning>
<answer>
Total daily expenses = $4000

Employees' salary costs:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times \$4000 = \$1600 \]

Remaining amount after employees' salary:
\[ \$4000 - \$1600 = \$2400 \]

Delivery costs:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times \$2400 = \$600 \]

Remaining amount after delivery costs (which is the amount spent on orders):
\[ \$2400 - \$600 = \$1800 \]

Therefore, Mr. Haj pays $1800 for the orders done.

-------------------- Question:
Ben has $2000 for his business operations costs. He orders goods from his supplier and writes them a cheque for $600. His debtor pays him $800 from the purchases they had made on credit. Mr. Ben then decides to do equipment maintenance and spends $1200 on the whole operation. How much money is Mr. Ben remaining with? 
Answer:
1000 
Response:
<reasoning>
Ben initially has $2000. After ordering goods, his balance is reduced by $600, leaving $2000 - $600 = $1400. When his debtors pay him, his balance increases by $800, making it $1400 + $800 = $2200. After spending $1200 on equipment maintenance, the remaining money he has is $2200 - $1200 = $1000.
</reasoning>
<answer>
Therefore, Mr. Ben is remaining with $1000.

There was only enough room for 21 people on a raft if no one wore life jackets. There were 7 fewer people who could fit on the raft if everyone wore life jackets. If 8 people on the raft needed life jackets, how many people could fit on the raft? 
Answer:
17 
Response:
<reasoning>
If no one wore life jackets, 21 people could fit on the raft. If everyone wore life jackets, there would be 7 fewer people who could fit on the raft. So with life jackets, 21 - 7 = 14 people could fit on the raft. 

Given that 8 people need life jackets, we have a total of 8 wearers of life jackets and 8 * 1 = 8 who don't. Thus, the raft can fit 14 non-wearers of life jackets and allows 8 of the life jacket wearers to be on the raft (since 8 wearers of life jackets + 8 non-wearers of life jackets = 14). 

Therefore, with 8 people needing life jackets, 14 people could fit on the raft.

-------------------- Question:
Nigella is a realtor who earns a base salary of $3,000 a month plus a 2% commission on every house she sells. One month, Nigella sells 3 houses and earns $8,000 total. House B costs three times as much as House A. House C cost twice as much as House A minus $110,000. How much did House A cost? 
Answer:
60000 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's denote the cost of House A as \( x \). According to the problem, House B cost three times as much as House A, so House B costs \( 3x \). House C costs twice as much as House A minus $110,000, which translates to \( 2x - 110,000 \). Nigella sells 3 houses in total, so the total commission earned from these sales is $8,000. Her base salary is $3,000.

First, calculate the total commission from selling the houses:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = 8,000 \]

Next, calculate the commission from each house sold assuming the only source of additional income is the commission from the sales. Since we have 3 houses sold, let's denote the sale amounts of Houses A, B, and C as \( x \), \( 3x \), and \( 2x - 110,000 \) respectively. Her commission from these sales is:
\[ 2\% \times (x + 3x + (2x - 110,000)) = 8,000 \]
\[ 2\% \times (6x - 110,000) = 8,000 \]
\[ \frac{6x - 110,000}{50} = 8,000 \]
\[ 6x - 110,000 = 400,000 \]
\[ 6x = 510,000 \]
\[ x = 85,000 \]

So, the cost of House A is $85,000.

Ayen jogs for 30 minutes every day during weekdays. This week on Tuesday, she jogged 5 minutes more and also jogged 25 minutes more on Friday. How many hours, in total, did Ayen jog this week? 
Answer:
3 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how many hours Ayen jogged this week, we first calculate her jogging time for each day of the week. Normally, Ayen jogs for 30 minutes every weekday. 

Given the following adjustments for Tuesday and Friday:
- Tuesday: 30 + 5 = 35 minutes
- Friday: 30 + 25 = 55 minutes

For the remaining days (Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday), she jogged the standard 30 minutes each day. 

We will then add up the jogging times for all the days to get the total minutes. Finally, we convert the total minutes into hours by dividing by 60.

Let's sum up the jogging minutes:
- Monday: 30 minutes
- Tuesday: 35 minutes
- Wednesday: 30 minutes
- Thursday: 30 minutes
- Friday: 55 minutes

Total jogging time in minutes: 30 + 35 + 30 + 30 + 55
</reasoning>
<answer>
Total jogging time is 190 minutes. Converting 190 minutes into hours:
\[ 190 \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours and } 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Ayen jogged this week is 3 hours and 10 minutes.

-------------------- Question:
A farmer is selling ducks and chickens at the market. He sells ducks for $10 and chickens for $8. He sells 5 chickens and some ducks. He then spends half his earnings on a new wheelbarrow. After buying it, someone sees it and agrees to pay the farmer double what the farmer paid and the farmer earns another $60. How many ducks did the farmer sell? 
Answer:
2 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's denote the number of ducks sold by \( d \).

The farmer earns from chickens as \( 5 \times 格 = 8d \), where \( 8d \) is the earnings from 5 chickens.

Earnings from ducks would be \( 10d \), so the total earnings would be \( 8d + 10d = 18d \).

Half of the earnings is spent on a new wheelbarrow, so the wheelbarrow costs \( 9d \). This wheelbarrow is sold for double its cost, which means it earns the farmer \( 2 \times 9d = 18d \).

The farmer earns an additional $60 after buying the wheelbarrow, so we can write the equation:
\[ 18d + 60 = 18d \]

This equation simplifies to:
\[ 60 = 0 \]

This equation is not possible as written, which means we need to consider the $60 extra separately. From the logic above, if \( 18d = 2 \times \text{cost of wheelbarrow}\), then the additional $60 would be \( 18d - 9d = 9d \), but it should be added separately to keep the system consistent. The correct approach would be to consider directly the earnings without the additional $60 until the wheelbarrow is sold.

Solving \( 18d - 9d = 60 \) gives us:
\[ 9d = 60 \]
\[ d = \frac{60}{9} \]
\[ d = 6.67 \]

Since the number of ducks must be a whole number and the construction of the problem suggests we should verify the arithmetic. The correct number of ducks, without the extra $60 step, should be:
\[ 9d = 60 \]
\[ d = 5 \]

Here, we have a consistent result with the arithmetic resolving around the right number 5.

Sara is 6 inches taller than her brother Joe. Joe is 3 inches taller than his friend Roy. If Roy is 36 inches tall, how tall is Sara? 
Answer:

To find Sara's height, we need to find Joe's height, and then use Sara's relative height to Joe to find her height. We know Roy's height, and Joe is 3 inches taller than Roy. From Joe's height, we can then determine Sara's height, which is 6 inches taller than Joe's.

1. Roy's height is given as 36 inches.
2. Joe is 3 inches taller than Roy, so Joe's height is \(36 + 3 = 39\) inches.
3. Sara is 6 inches taller than Joe, so Sara's height is \(39 + 6 = 45\) inches.

Rollo has 3 guinea pigs, the first guinea pig eats 2 cups of food, the second guinea pig eats twice as much as the first one, and the third guinea pig eats 3 cups more than the second one. How many cups of food does Rollo need to feed all his Guinea pigs? 
Answer:

Response:
<reasoning>
First, let's determine how much food each of Rollo's guinea pigs eats. The first guinea pig eats 2 cups of food. 

The second guinea pig eats twice as much as the first guinea pig, so the second guinea pig eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) cups of food.

The third guinea pig eats 3 cups more than the second guinea pig, so the third guinea pig eats \(4 + 3 = 7\) cups of food.

Next, let's add up the total food consumption for all three guinea pigs:

Louise is in a toy store. She already has 28 toys worth $10 each in her cart. On her way to the till she adds 20 teddy bears to the cart. If the $580 in Louise’s wallet is exactly enough to pay for all the toys, how much does each teddy bear cost? 
Answer:
15 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's denote the cost of each teddy bear as \( x \). The total cost of the toys Louise already has is $28 \times 10 = $280. Adding the cost of the 20 teddy bears, the total cost becomes $280 + 20x$. According to the problem, this total cost equals the $580 in Louise's wallet. 

So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 280 + 20x = 580 \]

Next, we'll isolate \( x \) by subtracting 280 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 20x = 300 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 20 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{300}{20} = 15 \]

Therefore, each teddy bear costs $15.

Donny bought 8 big apples, each costing $3, and the cost for the big apples can be calculated as 8 * $3. Then, Donny bought 6 small and medium apples. Let's assume he bought 4 small apples and 2 medium apples (since the exact composition isn't given, we can assume a hypothetical split to simplify the calculation). The cost for the 4 small apples would be 4 * $1.5 and the cost for the 2 medium apples would be 2 * $2. Adding the costs together will give us the total amount Donny has to pay.
</reasoning>
<answer>
Cost of 8 big apples = 8 * $3 = $24
Cost of 4 small apples = 4 * $1.5 = $6
Cost of 2 medium apples = 2 * $2 = $4
Total cost = Cost of big apples + Cost of small apples + Cost of medium apples
Total cost = $24 + $6 + $4 = $34
Therefore, Donny will have to pay $34 for all the apples.
</answer> 
Extracted:
Cost of 8 big apples = 8 * $3 = $24
Cost of 4 small apples = 4 * $1.5 = $6
Cost of 2 medium apples = 2 * $2 = $4
Total cost = Cost of big apples + Cost of small apples + Cost of medium apples
Total cost = $24 + $6 + $4 = $34
Therefore, Donny will have to pay $34 for all the apples.

-------------------- Question:
In April, Tank gathered 10 more Easter eggs than Emma in their first round of egg hunt. However, Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank in their second round of egg hunt, while Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the number she had gathered in the first round. If the total number of eggs in the pile they were collecting with 6 other people was 400 eggs, and Emma gathered 60 eggs in the second egg hunt round, find the number of eggs that the 6 other egg hunters collected? 
Answer:
220 
Response:
<reasoning>
Let's break down the problem step-bymlt to find the total number of eggs collected by the 6 other people.

1. **Identify the terms and relationships:**
   - In the first round, Tank gathered 10 more eggs than Emma.
   - In the second round, Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank.
   - Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the first.
   - Emma gathered 60 eggs in the second round.
   
2. **Let's denote the variables:**
   - Denote \( E_1 \) as Emma's eggs in the first round, and \( T_1 \) as Tank's eggs in the first round. Therefore, \( T_1 = E_1 + 10 \).
   - Denote Emma's eggs in the second round as \( E_2 = 60 \).
   - Denote Tank's eggs in the second round as \( T_2 \). According to the problem, \( T_2 = E_2 \times 2 = 120 \) eggs, and \( T_2 = T_1 - 20 \).

3. **Calculate the number of eggs Tank gathered in the first round:**
   \( T_2 = T_1 - 20 \Rightarrow 120 = T_1 - 20 \Rightarrow T_1 = 140 \).

4. **Calculate the number of eggs Emma gathered in the first round:**
   \( T_1 = E_1 + 10 \Rightarrow 140 = E_1 + 10 \Rightarrow E_1 = 130 \).

5. **Calculate the total number of eggs Tank collected:**

   - First round: \( T_1 = 140 \)
   - Second round: \( T_2 = 120 \)
   - Total for Tank: \( T_{total} = 140 + 120 = 260 \).

6. **Emma's total collection:**
   She gathered:
   - First round: \( E_1 = 130 \)
   - Second round: \( E_2 = 60 \)
   Total for Emma: \( E_{total} = 130 + 60 = 190 \).

-------------------- Question:
Jake agrees to work part of his debt off.  He owed someone $100 but paid them $40 before agreeing to work off the rest.   He worked for $15 an hour.  How many hours did he have to work? 
Answer:
4 
Response:
<reasoning>
Jake's remaining debt after paying $40 from his $100 debt is $100 - $40 = $60. Since he works for $15 an hour, the number of hours he needs to work to pay off the $60 can be calculated by dividing $60 by $15 per hour. Thus, the number of hours is $60 / $15 = 4 hours.
</reasoning>
<answer>
Jake had to work for 4 hours.

Addilynn went to the grocery store and bought six dozen eggs for use in her house. After two weeks, she used half of the eggs, then accidentally broke 15 of the remaining eggs while moving them to clean the shelves. How many eggs are left on the shelf? 
Answer:
21 
Response:
<reasoning>
Initially, Addilynn bought six dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, six dozen is equal to \(6 \times 12 = 72\) eggs. After two weeks, she used half of the eggs, which means she used \(72 / 2 = 36\) eggs. This leaves her with \(72 - 36 = 36\) eggs. She then accidentally broke 15 of the remaining eggs, so the number of eggs left is \(36 - 15 = 21\) eggs.
