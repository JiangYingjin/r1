-------------------- Question:
A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all? 
Answer:
476 
Response:
<reasoning>
Mr. Benson bought 12 concert tickets. The first 10 tickets were bought at full price, and the additional 2 tickets received a 5% discount.

The cost of each ticket at full price is $40. The cost of each discounted ticket is $40 * (1 - 0.05) = $40 * 0.95 = $38.

So, Mr. Benson paid $40 * 10 = $400 for the first 10 tickets.
And for the additional 2 tickets, he paid $38 * 2 = $76.

Therefore, the total amount Mr. Benson paid is $400 + $76 = $476.
