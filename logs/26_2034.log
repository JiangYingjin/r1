-------------------- Question:
A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all? 
Answer:
476 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how much Mr. Benson paid, we need to calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets and then apply the discount for the remaining 2 tickets.

1. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets:**
   - Each ticket costs $40.
   - Therefore, the cost for 10 tickets is \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the additional 2 tickets with a discount:**
   - Normally, each ticket costs $40.
   - He receives a 5% discount for each ticket beyond the 10th.
   - The discount per ticket is \(5\% \times 40 = 0.05 \times 40 = 2\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the discounted price per ticket is \(40 - 2 = 38\) dollars.
   - The cost for 2 discounted tickets is \(2 \times 38 = 76\) dollars.

Jane is trying to decide whether to buy a house or a trailer. A house costs $480,000 and a trailer costs $120,000. Each loan will be paid in monthly installments over 20 years. How much more is the monthly payment on the house compared to the trailer? 
Answer:
1500 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how much more the monthly payment on the house is compared to the trailer, we first need to calculate the monthly payments for each option. Both the house and the trailer will be financed through a loan that will be paid over 20 years. 

The formula for calculating the monthly payment on an amortizing loan is given by:

\[
M = \frac{P \cdot r \cdot (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

where:
- \( M \) is the monthly payment,
- \( P \) is the principal loan amount (the cost of the house or trailer),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12),
- \( n \) is the total number of payments (loan term in years multiplied by 12).

The problem does not specify the interest rate, so we will assume there is no interest (0% interest rate) for simplicity.

Janet pays $40/hour for 3 hours per week of clarinet lessons and $28/hour for 5 hours a week of piano lessons. How much more does she spend on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year? 
Answer:
1040 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how much more Janet spends on piano lessons than on clarinet lessons in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the weekly cost of each lesson:**
   - **Clarinet lessons:** 
     - Janet pays $40 per hour and takes 3 hours per week.
     - Weekly cost = $40/hour * 3 hours/week = $120/week.
   - **Piano lessons:** 
     - Janet pays $28 per hour and takes 5 hours per week.
     - Weekly cost = $28/hour * 5 hours/week = $140/week.

2. **Calculate the annual cost of each lesson:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - **Annual cost for clarinet lessons:**
     - Annual cost = $120/week * 52 weeks/year = $6,240/year.

Sabrina is collecting herbs to make a poultice for her grandmother. She needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves and 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. If she needs 12 basil leaves, how many leaves total does she need? 
Answer:
29 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information provided:

1. Sabrina needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves.
   - Let \( b \) represent the number of basil leaves and \( s \) represent the number of sage leaves.
   - The relationship is given by: 
     \[
     b = 2s
     \]
   - We know from the problem that \( b = 12 \). Substituting into the equation:
     \[
     12 = 2s
     \]
   - Solving for \( s \):
     \[
     s = \frac{12}{2} = 6
     \]

2. Sabrina needs 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves.
   - Let \( v \) represent the number of verbena leaves.
   - The relationship is given by:
     \[
     s = v - 5
     \]

Over the past five years, on July 4th, the high temperature for Washington, DC has been: 90 degrees in 2020, 90 degrees in 2019, 90 degrees in 2018, 79 degrees in 2017 and 71 degrees in 2016. What is the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past 5 years? 
Answer:
84 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the average temperature over the past five years, we first need to sum up the high temperatures for each year and then divide by the number of years.

The temperatures for the past five years are as follows:
- 2020: 90 degrees
- 2019: 90 degrees
- 2018: 90 degrees
- 2017: 79 degrees
- 2016: 71 degrees

First, calculate the sum of these temperatures:
\[ 90 + 90 + 90 + 79 + 71 = 420 \]

Next, divide the total sum by the number of years (5) to find the average:
\[ \frac{420}{5} = 84 \]

Therefore, the average high temperature for July 4th over the past five years is 84 degrees.

Rene can finish reading 30 pages in 60 minutes. Lulu can read 27 pages in 60 minutes and Cherry can read 25 pages in 60 minutes. If they have been reading for 240 minutes now, how many pages have they finished reading in total? 
Answer:
328 
Response:
<reasoning>
First, we determine the reading rates for Rene, Lulu, and Cherry in pages per minute:
- Rene reads 30 pages in 60 minutes, so his rate is \( \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \) pages per minute.
- Lulu reads 27 pages in 60 minutes, so her rate is \( \frac{27}{60} = 0.45 \) pages per minute.
- Cherry reads 25 pages in 60 minutes, so her rate is \( \frac{25}{60} \approx 0.4167 \) pages per minute.

Next, we calculate how many pages each person reads in 240 minutes:
- Rene: \( 0.5 \times 240 = 120 \) pages.
- Lulu: \( 0.45 \times 240 = 108 \) pages.

Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than 1/3 as often as the big bell. If he rings both of them a combined total of 52 times, how many times does he ring the big bell? 
Answer:
36 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

1. Let \( x \) represent the number of times Martin rings the big bell.
2. According to the problem, Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than 1/3 as often as the big bell. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Times small bell is rung} = \frac{x}{3} + 4
   \]
3. We also know that the combined total rings of both bells is 52. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + \left(\frac{x}{3} + 4\right) = 52

4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{3} + 4 = 52

Bert fills out the daily crossword puzzle in the newspaper every day. He uses up a pencil to fill out the puzzles every two weeks. On average, it takes him 1050 words to use up a pencil. How many words are in each crossword puzzle on average? 
Answer:

Response:
<reasoning>
To determine the average number of words in each crossword puzzle, we first need to understand the time frame and the number of words written.

2. Bert uses up a pencil every two weeks, and during this period, he writes a total of 1050 words.

3. To find the average number of words in each crossword puzzle, we divide the total number of words written in two weeks by the number of crossword puzzles completed in that period.

To determine how many cookies are left after Jim eats 15 cookies, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of flour Matt has:**
   - Matt uses 4 bags of flour, each weighing 5 pounds.
   - Total flour = 4 bags Ã— 5 pounds/bag = 20 pounds of flour.

2. **Determine how many batches Matt can make with the flour:**
   - Each batch of a dozen (12) cookies requires 2 pounds of flour.
