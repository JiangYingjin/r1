-------------------- Question:
A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all? 
Answer:
476 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how much Mr. Benson paid, we need to calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets and then apply the discount for the remaining 2 tickets.

1. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets:**
   - Each ticket costs $40.
   - Therefore, the cost for 10 tickets is \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the additional 2 tickets with a discount:**
   - Normally, each ticket costs $40.
   - He receives a 5% discount for each ticket beyond the 10th.
   - The discount per ticket is \(5\% \times 40 = 0.05 \times 40 = 2\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the discounted price per ticket is \(40 - 2 = 38\) dollars.
   - The cost for 2 discounted tickets is \(2 \times 38 = 76\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   - Add the cost of the first 10 tickets and the cost of the discounted 2 tickets:  
   \(400 + 76 = 476\) dollars.

Thus, Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for all 12 tickets.

-------------------- Question:
Jane is trying to decide whether to buy a house or a trailer. A house costs $480,000 and a trailer costs $120,000. Each loan will be paid in monthly installments over 20 years. How much more is the monthly payment on the house compared to the trailer? 
Answer:
1500 
Response:
<reasoning>
To compare the monthly payments for both the house and the trailer, we will calculate the monthly payments for each and then find the difference. We assume the following for simplicity:

1. **Loan Amounts:**
   - House: $480,000
   - Trailer: $120,000

2. **Loan Term:** 20 years = 240 months

3. **Interest Rate:** Without explicit information on the interest rate, we typically use a common mortgage rate when evaluating scenarios like this. However, without specific information, we might use a hypothetical interest rate for demonstration purposes. Let's assume a common mortgage interest rate of 4% per annum (0.04/12 per month) for both loans. 

The formula to calculate the monthly payment \( M \) for a loan is given by:

\[
M = P \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal loan amount,
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of payments.

Let's calculate the monthly payment for both the house and the trailer using this formula.

**Step-by-step Calculations:**

1. **Calculate \( r \):**  
   The annual interest rate is 4%, so the monthly interest rate \( r \) is:  
   \[
   r = \frac{0.04}{12} = 0.003333\ldots
   \]

2. **Calculate \( n \):**  
   The loan term is 20 years, so \( n \) is:  
   \[
   n = 20 \times 12 = 240
   \]

3. **Monthly Payment for the House:**  
   \[
   M_{\text{house}} = 480,000 \times \frac{0.003333\ldots(1 + 0.003333\ldots)^{240}}{(1 + 0.003

Janet pays $40/hour for 3 hours per week of clarinet lessons and $28/hour for 5 hours a week of piano lessons. How much more does she spend on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year? 
Answer:
1040 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how much more Janet spends on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year, we need to calculate her weekly and then annual spending for each type of lesson, and then compare the two.

1. **Clarinet Lessons:**
   - Janet pays $40 per hour for clarinet lessons.
   - She has 3 hours of clarinet lessons per week.
   - Weekly cost for clarinet lessons = $40/hour * 3 hours/week = $120/week.
   - Annual cost for clarinet lessons = $120/week * 52 weeks/year = $6,240/year.

2. **Piano Lessons:**
   - Janet pays $28 per hour for piano lessons.
   - She has 5 hours of piano lessons per week.
   - Weekly cost for piano lessons = $28/hour * 5 hours/week = $140/week.
   - Annual cost for piano lessons = $140/week * 52 weeks/year = $7,280/year.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Difference in annual spending = Annual cost for piano lessons - Annual cost for clarinet lessons.
   - Difference = $7,280/year - $6,240/year = $1,040/year.

Janet spends $1,040 more on piano lessons than on clarinet lessons in a year.

-------------------- Question:
Sabrina is collecting herbs to make a poultice for her grandmother. She needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves and 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. If she needs 12 basil leaves, how many leaves total does she need? 
Answer:
29 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out the total number of leaves Sabrina needs, we will go through the relationships and values step by step.

1. **Determine the number of sage leaves:**
   - Sabrina needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves.
   - She has 12 basil leaves.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of sage leaves.
   - From the problem, we know: 
     \[
     2S = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{12}{2} = 6
     \]

2. **Determine the number of verbena leaves:**
   - Sabrina needs 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. Assume \( V \) is the number of verbena leaves.
   - Given that she needs 6 sage leaves, we have:
     \[
     S = V - 5
     \]
   - Substitute \( S = 6 \) into the equation:
     \[
     6 = V - 5
     \]
   - Solving for \( V \):
     \[
     V = 6 + 5 = 11
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of leaves:**
   - Sabrina collects three types of leaves: basil, sage, and verbena.
   - Total number of leaves is the sum of basil, sage, and verbena leaves:
     \[
     \text{Total leaves} = \text{Basil leaves} + \text{Sage leaves} + \text{Verbena leaves}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total leaves} = 12 + 6 + 11 = 29
     \]

Thus, the total number of leaves Sabrina needs is 29.
