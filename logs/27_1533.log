-------------------- Question:
A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all? 
Answer:
476 
Response:
<reasoning>
To solve this problem, we need to consider the discounted price for the additional tickets after the first 1ml. The initial 10 tickets are bought at the full price, and the remaining 2 tickets are bought at a discounted price. The price of each ticket is $40, and the discount on each ticket is 5% for the tickets exceeding 10.

First, calculate the total price for the first 10 tickets:
\[ 10 \times \$40 = \$400 \]

Next, calculate the discount rate for the additional tickets:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } \$40 = 0.05 \times \$40 = \$2 \]

The discounted price per ticket for the additional ones:
\[ \$40 - \$2 = \$38 \]

Now, calculate the total cost for the extra 2 tickets at the discounted price:
\[ 2 \times \$38 =
