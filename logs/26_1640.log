A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all? 
Answer:
476 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how much Mr. Benson paid, we need to calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets and then apply the discount for the remaining 2 tickets.

1. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets:**
   - Each ticket costs $40.
   - Therefore, the cost for 10 tickets is \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the additional 2 tickets with a discount:**
   - Normally, each ticket costs $40.
   - He receives a 5% discount for each ticket beyond the 10th.
   - The discount per ticket is \(5\% \times 40 = 0.05 \times 40 = 2\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the discounted price per ticket is \(40 - 2 = 38\) dollars.
   - The cost for 2 discounted tickets is \(2 \times 38 = 76\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   - Add the cost of the first 10 tickets and the cost of the discounted 2 tickets:  
   \(400 + 76 = 476\) dollars.

Thus, Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for all 12 tickets.

-------------------- Question:
Jane is trying to decide whether to buy a house or a trailer. A house costs $480,000 and a trailer costs $120,000. Each loan will be paid in monthly installments over 20 years. How much more is the monthly payment on the house compared to the trailer? 
Answer:
1500 
Response:
<reasoning>
To compare the monthly payments for both the house and the trailer, we will calculate the monthly payments for each and then find the difference. We assume the following for simplicity:

1. **Loan Amounts:**
   - House: $480,000
   - Trailer: $120,000

2. **Loan Term:** 20 years = 240 months

3. **Interest Rate:** Without explicit information on the interest rate, we typically use a common mortgage rate when evaluating scenarios like this. However, without specific information, we might use a hypothetical interest rate for demonstration purposes. Let's assume a common mortgage interest rate of 4% per annum (0.04/12 per month) for both loans. 

The formula to calculate the monthly payment \( M \) for a loan is given by:

\[
M = P \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal loan amount,
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of payments.

Let's calculate the monthly payment for both the house and the trailer using this formula.

**Step-by-step Calculations:**

1. **Calculate \( r \):**  
   The annual interest rate is 4%, so the monthly interest rate \( r \) is:  
   \[
   r = \frac{0.04}{12} = 0.003333\ldots
   \]

2. **Calculate \( n \):**  
   The loan term is 20 years, so \( n \) is:  
   \[
   n = 20 \times 12 = 240
   \]

3. **Monthly Payment for the House:**  
   \[
   M_{\text{house}} = 480,000 \times \frac{0.003333\ldots(1 + 0.003333\ldots)^{240}}{(1 + 0.003

Janet pays $40/hour for 3 hours per week of clarinet lessons and $28/hour for 5 hours a week of piano lessons. How much more does she spend on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year? 
Answer:
1040 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how much more Janet spends on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year, we need to calculate her weekly and then annual spending for each type of lesson, and then compare the two.

1. **Clarinet Lessons:**
   - Janet pays $40 per hour for clarinet lessons.
   - She has 3 hours of clarinet lessons per week.
   - Weekly cost for clarinet lessons = $40/hour * 3 hours/week = $120/week.
   - Annual cost for clarinet lessons = $120/week * 52 weeks/year = $6,240/year.

2. **Piano Lessons:**
   - Janet pays $28 per hour for piano lessons.
   - She has 5 hours of piano lessons per week.
   - Weekly cost for piano lessons = $28/hour * 5 hours/week = $140/week.
   - Annual cost for piano lessons = $140/week * 52 weeks/year = $7,280/year.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Difference in annual spending = Annual cost for piano lessons - Annual cost for clarinet lessons.
   - Difference = $7,280/year - $6,240/year = $1,040/year.

Janet spends $1,040 more on piano lessons than on clarinet lessons in a year.

-------------------- Question:
Sabrina is collecting herbs to make a poultice for her grandmother. She needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves and 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. If she needs 12 basil leaves, how many leaves total does she need? 
Answer:
29 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out the total number of leaves Sabrina needs, we will go through the relationships and values step by step.

1. **Determine the number of sage leaves:**
   - Sabrina needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves.
   - She has 12 basil leaves.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of sage leaves.
   - From the problem, we know: 
     \[
     2S = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{12}{2} = 6
     \]

2. **Determine the number of verbena leaves:**
   - Sabrina needs 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. Assume \( V \) is the number of verbena leaves.
   - Given that she needs 6 sage leaves, we have:
     \[
     S = V - 5
     \]
   - Substitute \( S = 6 \) into the equation:
     \[
     6 = V - 5
     \]
   - Solving for \( V \):
     \[
     V = 6 + 5 = 11
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of leaves:**
   - Sabrina collects three types of leaves: basil, sage, and verbena.
   - Total number of leaves is the sum of basil, sage, and verbena leaves:
     \[
     \text{Total leaves} = \text{Basil leaves} + \text{Sage leaves} + \text{Verbena leaves}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total leaves} = 12 + 6 + 11 = 29
     \]

Thus, the total number of leaves Sabrina needs is 29.

Over the past five years, on July 4th, the high temperature for Washington, DC has been: 90 degrees in 2020, 90 degrees in 2019, 90 degrees in 2018, 79 degrees in 2017 and 71 degrees in 2016. What is the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past 5 years? 
Answer:
84 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the specified years, we need to calculate the mean of the high temperatures listed for each of those years.

Here are the high temperatures for each year:
- 2020: 90 degrees
- 2019: 90 degrees
- 2018: 90 degrees
- 2017: 79 degrees
- 2016: 71 degrees

To calculate the average (mean) temperature, we sum all the temperatures and then divide by the number of years (which is 5 in this case).

1. Sum the temperatures:
   \[
   90 + 90 + 90 + 79 + 71 = 420
   \]

2. Divide the sum by the number of years:
   \[
   \frac{420}{5} = 84
   \]

Thus, the average temperature for July 4th over the past five years is 84 degrees.

Rene can finish reading 30 pages in 60 minutes. Lulu can read 27 pages in 60 minutes and Cherry can read 25 pages in 60 minutes. If they have been reading for 240 minutes now, how many pages have they finished reading in total? 
Answer:
328 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how many pages the three people have read in total, we first determine the reading rate of each person:

1. **Rene's reading rate**: 
   - Rene reads 30 pages in 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, Rene reads \( \frac{30 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.5 \text{ pages per minute} \).

2. **Lulu's reading rate**: 
   - Lulu reads 27 pages in 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, Lulu reads \( \frac{27 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.45 \text{ pages per minute} \).

3. **Cherry's reading rate**: 
   - Cherry reads 25 pages in 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, Cherry reads \( \frac{25 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.4167 \text{ pages per minute} \).

Next, we calculate how many pages each one has read in 240 minutes:

1. **Pages Rene read**: 
   - Rene reads \( 0.5 \text{ pages per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ pages} \).

2. **Pages Lulu read**: 
   - Lulu reads \( 0.45 \text{ pages per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 108 \text{ pages} \).

3. **Pages Cherry read**: 
   - Cherry reads \( 0.4167 \text{ pages per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} \approx 100 \text{ pages} \).

Finally, we sum the total pages read by all three:

- Total pages read = \( 120 \text{ pages} + 108 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 328 \text{ pages} \).

Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than 1/3 as often as the big bell. If he rings both of them a combined total of 52 times, how many times does he ring the big bell? 
Answer:
36 
Response:
To solve this problem, let's define some variables:

- Let \( x \) be the number of times the big bell is rung.
- According to the problem, Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than \(\frac{1}{3}\) as often as the big bell. Therefore, the number of times the small bell is rung is \(\frac{x}{3} + 4\).

We are also given that the total number of rings for both bells is 52. This can be expressed as:

\[
x + \left(\frac{x}{3} + 4\right) = 52
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
x + \frac{x}{3} + 4 = 52
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\[
x + \frac{x}{3} = 48
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 3:

\[
3x + x = 144
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
4x = 144
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 36
\]

Thus, the number of times the big bell is rung is 36.

<reasoning>
We defined \( x \) as the number of times the big bell is rung. The small bell is rung \(\frac{x}{3} + 4\) times. We set up the equation based on the total number of rings, \( x + \left(\frac{x}{3} + 4\right) = 52 \). Simplifying and solving the equation led us to find \( x = 36 \).

Answer:
75 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find out how many words are in each crossword puzzle on average, we need to establish the total number of words Bert writes in two weeks and then determine the average number of words per day.

1. **Total Words in Two Weeks:** We know that it takes Bert 1050 words to use up a pencil over a two-week period. This means he writes 1050 words every 14 days.

2. **Average Words per Day:** To find the average number of words he writes per day, we divide the total number of words by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Average words per day} = \frac{1050 \text{ words}}{14 \text{ days}} = 75 \text{ words per day}
   \]

Matt can make a batch of a dozen cookies using 2 pounds of flour.  He uses 4 bags of flour each weighing 5 pounds.  If Jim eats 15 cookies how many cookies are left? 
Answer:
105 
Response:
<reasoning>
1. First, we determine how many cookies can be made from 4 bags of flour. Each bag weighs 5 pounds, so 4 bags weigh:
   \[
   4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ pounds of flour}
   \]

2. According to the problem, Matt can make a dozen (12) cookies with 2 pounds of flour. Therefore, the number of dozens of cookies he can make with 20 pounds of flour can be calculated by finding out how many 2-pound portions are in 20 pounds:
   \[
   \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ dozens of cookies}
   \]

3. Since one dozen equals 12 cookies, 10 dozens of cookies is:
   \[
   10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ cookies}
   \]

4. Jim eats 15 cookies, so the number of cookies remaining is:
   \[
   120 - 15 = 105 \text{ cookies}

James decides to build a tin house by collecting 500 tins in a week. On the first day, he collects 50 tins. On the second day, he manages to collect 3 times that number. On the third day, he collects 50 tins fewer than the number he collected on the second day. If he collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days of the week, what's the number of tins he collected each day for the rest of the week? 
Answer:
50 
Response:
<reasoning>
1. **Establish initial data based on the problem statement:**
   - Day 1: James collects 50 tins.
   - Day 2: James collects 3 times the number of tins collected on Day 1. Therefore, he collects \(3 \times 50 = 150\) tins.
   - Day 3: James collects 50 tins fewer than on Day 2. Therefore, he collects \(150 - 50 = 100\) tins.

2. **Calculate the total number of tins collected in the first three days:**
   \[
   \text{Total for first 3 days} = 50 + 150 + 100 = 300 \text{ tins}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tins James still needs to collect:**
   - Total tins needed: 500
   - Tins already collected in the first 3 days: 300
   \[
   \text{Tins remaining to be collected} = 500 - 300 = 200 \text{ tins}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of days remaining in the week:**
   - Total days in a week: 7
   - Days used: 3
   \[
   \text{Days remaining} = 7 - 3 = 4 \text{ days}

5. **Determine the number of tins collected each day for the remaining 4 days:**
   - Total tins to be collected on the remaining days: 200 tins
   - Number of days to collect these tins: 4 days
   \[
   \text{Tins collected per remaining day} = \frac{200}{4} = 50 \text{ tins per day}

1. **Establish initial data based on the problem statement:**
   - Day 1: James collects 50 tins.
   - Day 2: James collects 3 times the number of tins collected on Day 1. Therefore, he collects \(3 \times 50 = 150\) tins.
   - Day 3: James collects 50 tins fewer than on Day 2. Therefore, he collects \(150 - 50 = 100\) tins.

2. **Calculate the total number of tins collected in the first three days:**
   \[
   \text{Total for first 3 days} = 50 + 150 + 100 = 300 \text{ tins}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tins James still needs to collect:**
   - Total tins needed: 500
   - Tins already collected in the first 3 days: 300
   \[
   \text{Tins remaining to be collected} = 500 - 300 = 200 \text{ tins}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of days remaining in the week:**
   - Total days in a week: 7
   - Days used: 3
   \[
   \text{Days remaining} = 7 - 3 = 4 \text{ days}
   \]

5. **Determine the number of tins collected each day for the remaining 4 days:**
   - Total tins to be collected on the remaining days: 200 tins
   - Number of days to collect these tins: 4 days
   \[
   \text{Tins collected per remaining day} = \frac{200}{4} = 50 \text{ tins per day}
